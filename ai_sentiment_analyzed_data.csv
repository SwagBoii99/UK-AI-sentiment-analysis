Reddit,"Email from Microsoft on the upcoming referendum. Ahead of the referendum in June, we've been asked by employees, customers and partners about Microsoft's view on the UK's membership of the European Union. As a business in an industry which will be affected by the decision we have carefully examined our position.

First and foremost, we want to emphasise that we firmly believe this is a decision for individual voters to make, based on the issues that are most important to them. We appreciate and respect that there are a range of reasons that motivate people on both sides of the debate, but as a business that is very committed to this country, our view is that the UK should remain in the EU. 

We have a long history here. It's where we opened our first international office in 1982 and we have been investing in the UK ever since. We have more than 5,000 highly qualified people working in fields including support, marketing, gaming, communications, cybersecurity and computer science research. We've built a global centre of excellence for the development of artificial intelligence and other computing disciplines. We've also worked in partnership with innovators, entrepreneurs and people with a passion for technology to help to create a thriving partner network of around 25,000 British businesses. 

Historically, the UK being part of the EU has been one of several important criteria that make it one of the most attractive places in Europe for the range of investments we have made. At key moments in our international growth we have specifically chosen to invest in our capabilities here in the UK. Most recently, we announced that we would start offering cloud services this year from new UK-based data centres. And as we've grown, so too have the UK technology businesses we work with. 

For us, the UK's membership of a wider EU was also a key reason why we chose to invest in our first overseas R&D laboratory in Cambridge. Why? Because we knew that the world-leading scientists we wanted to attract would want and need to work directly alongside other great researchers from across the region. This flexibility of doing business attracts the best people, and the investment that follows them, to the UK. 
Whatever the outcome of the referendum, we respect the decisions made by UK voters. Our commitment to our staff and business here remains firm, but we also believe the UK remaining in the EU supports important criteria for continued and future investment by Microsoft and others. 

Yours sincerely,

Michel Van der Bel

Reddit,"Students of West of England University or Northumbira University, what do/did you think?. My grades really held me back but I've managed to get into Northumbria through clearing thanks to my work experience. I plan to study their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence course.

The modules look awesome, I think they'd all be enjoyable and useful in their own right. I haven't seen many low tier universities offer an AI and robotics module like Northumbria.

Has anyone studied there? What is it like being a student there? I know that it was traditionally a business focused university so I fear it won't be the best place to study a course like Comp Sci.

I also came across West of England University yesterday evening and the course' focus on AI really intrigued me.

Reddit,"What is our banking system? Part 3 [OC]. I never actually finished my third post so thought I'd do it now. I think although almost nobody read them - the people who did enjoyed them. So here goes part 3 - the impact of the changes.

In the last three or four decades a new system has emerged. This landscape of financial instruments and “innovation” was facilitated by deregulation under a neoliberal ideology.

The new system was supposed to be safer and more efficient. The belief was that greater freedom of contract would maximise the chance that financial market actors could come up with innovative ways to assess risk and price assets.

“Free market” economists argued that a contract would only be signed when all parties know they would benefit. To quote Joe Cassano (AIG - bailed out by government in 2008) 6 months before the crash.

>‘It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of the [CDS] transactions.

This belief was shared by the regulators. Nobody believed there was a bubble. But it burst anyway in 2007-2008. CDO markets and the CDss that fed on it collapsed. Biggest crisis since the great depression.

The financial system grew vastly more complex - can’t be overstated. Andy Haldane, the executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England, once pointed out that in order to fully understand a CDO2 – one of the more, but not the most, complicated new financial products – a prospective investor needs to absorb more than one billion pages of information. [Source for that](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2009/rethinking-the-financial-network.pdf).

Mathematical models were developed to deal with these complicated instruments. But they were completely inadequate. According to these models, the chances of what happened in 2008 actually happening were equivalent to winning the lottery twenty-one or twenty-two times in a row.

Part of this came from a loosening of what a legitimate financial contract is (allowing index-based derivatives etc.) and increased trading and pooling. Beginning with the neoliberal shift the US and UK relaxed financial regulations: prudential regulation for commercial banks, especially liquidity regulation and leverage regulation; ceilings on interest rates that lenders can charge; restrictions on asset types that different financial firms can hold, such as pre-1980s restrictions on US Savings & Loan institutions against making consumer loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans; rules on how aggressive the lending can be (e.g., rules on loan-to-house-value ratio for mortgage loans); and the relaxation, and frequently abolition, of restrictions on cross-border movement of capital.

This resulted in a web of connections. Different sectors (commercial banks and insurance companies getting involved in derivatives) but also across countries. So a problem with one part of the system extends to the entire system. We never really escaped the fact that those financial products were still underpinned by a small loan for a Toyota.

The financial industry also changed the way non-financial corporations ran. Short-term profits for shareholders became prescient. With so many financial instruments that give quick and high returns investors became impatient. E.g., in the UK, the average period of shareholding, which had already fallen from five years in the mid-1960s to two years in the 1980s, plummeted to about 7.5 months at the end of 2007. This meant higher salaries for managers in return for short-term shareholder profits. Bigger proportion of of profits to shareholders with dividends and share buy-backs.

Such practices left very few resources with which the company could invest in things like machines, R&D and training, reducing its long-term productivity and thus competitiveness. When the company gets into trouble, most of the professional managers and short-term shareholders who orchestrated the demise are not even with the company any more.

Given the higher returns that financial assets bring compared with traditional businesses, many companies have increasingly diverted their resources to the management of financial assets away from research and development etc.

As an example GE capital by General Electric became so large the US government designated it one of the ‘systematically important financial institutions’ (SIFIs) – a status usually reserved for only the biggest banks.

Under the new regime, the financial sector has become much more profitable than the non-financial sector. Offered higher salaries and bonuses so attracted the brightest people. For instance for me (artificial intelligence) the most profitable job I could get is at a bank. I know mathematicians doing the same. And engineers and programmers.

Concentration of wealth also enables effective lobbying giving them more control. A lot of regulators are also former financial sector workers. But not just corruption - ideological conviction in the neoliberal project believes fundamentally that maximum freedom of the markets is in our interests.

**####### Some thoughts on this whole expirience: #######**

1. **The reddit community is the most supportive** and helpful I have ever seen. (and I'm online since the IRC & icq in the 90s). I have received a number of very helpful advices, contact info of people who can actually help me (they are all in the thread and I hope other people with similar issue like mine will use them). My twitter was literally few weeks old with 20 followers and you guys retweeted me 500 times in a matter of few hours (before it got blocked). **Nothing but respect!**
2. Amazon is very hard to deal with if your issue is not a standard one - when you need an actual person, who can understand the logic and have to think in order to help you. **IF you make big fuzz on social though, they help you very fast and are super nice** \- this is both sad and good. Sad, coz I got lucky with you retweeting me, but good as there are obviously good people over there that want to help you. But it's hard to reach them (and they are definetely not in their chat - you want to talk on the phone with real people). **Advice - chat as quickly as possible, so you bypass the chat, then you recieve email ""did the chat solve your problem"" click NO and then click ""do you want us to call you""** \- you have way better chances to get to talk with someone who can actually help. If you see the person on the phone is one of these ""Is there anything else"" - **there is no point of reasoning with them. Waste of time and good energy. Just hang up and repeat the whole chat-> NO -> phone thing** \- it is annoying, but not everyone gets lucky his thread to become viral :/
3. I know it was mentioned already, but if you buy something expensive - **open the box before you sign**. There may be warehouse mixup, thief driver, bad people raid the van while driver delivers - all kind of variables that are very hard to be prevented even if you are a trilion dollar company with AI and everything - so take these extra 20 seconds, check the box and save yourself weeks of head in the wall moments trying to get your money back
4. Curve support is OK (I dealt with them on few occasions before - they are slow, but helpful. If you show them you posted your issue on a very visible place they are way faster. This is the same sad and good as in point 2.)
5. Sadly the way to resolve your issues fast and efficiently is to cry on social. It is very annoying and kind of looks like people blackmailing businesses, but between the choice of losing a grand and be annoying crying person I think most would choose the latter.

\########## Thread re-ordered chronologically, latest updates are at the bottom ####

**Full story so far:**

On Nov 29th (black friday) I ordered an Asus laptop worth £947. I have paid and got notified I will get it monday. Great! I have been ordering from amazon since 2006 and I never had any issues - if they say I will get it in 3 days, I know I will.

On Monday afternoon, Dec 2nd I happily signed for the box the delivery guy got me, and continued my work. I noticed the box was a bit lighter than I expected and thought **""Great! This laptop is even lighter than I thought""** (I don't like heavy laptops)

When I opened the box a bit later, there was the first bitter surprise - **instead of a £947 laptop, inside the amazon box were PHOTO FRAMES**

[My £947 laptop](https://preview.redd.it/m3kc86o26f541.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e6d27ff54086ee42e5edaea2e371e161d552bd0)

OK, this happens, I will just contact Amazon and they will fix this. They are big, black friday is their busiest day in the year, it's only human to make a mistake...

So I contact their customer support, they apologize, that model is already sold out and they can only refund me. ""It's fine"" I say. **They assure me I will get refund the moment I return the box** with the wrong item sent and just to print the hermes label and send it back. 

>*Hello,I'm sorry to hear of the mix up with your order.Firstly, please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused by this situation.Normally, in this situation, I'd create a replacement order for the incorrect item right away, to be sent to you as soon as possible at no additional charge.Unfortunately, at the moment, this item is unavailable from our suppliers and we can't send a replacement. However, we'll be happy to issue a refund.Please return the wrong item to us and we'll refund you as soon as possible.Please click on the following link to be brought to your personalised return label and follow the instructions provided...*

As a good customer, I print the label, I go to the local hermes and I send back the one pound worth photo frames (I guess their process is automated so they need that for easy process, well they have been delivering to me for years, the least I can do is do that 10 minute trip).

And I wait. Waited a week - no news. I check and they received my return just 2 days after I sent it. No notification. Nothing. So I contacted them to see when I will receive the immediate refund I was promised. Which led to probably the most frustrating chat I had with customer service in my life - Attaching the screenshots of the chat:

[Amazon tries everything to get rid of me and there's no way i get my money back](https://preview.redd.it/xw9v0qha7f541.jpg?width=4612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90769bf4582b76ea2c772c642cd3c651d4bc5d60)

[So I'm paying for something I never received, and I can't even have it's serial number or mac address so i provide it to the police](https://preview.redd.it/v26m4nff7f541.jpg?width=3242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e373cf7e16c498c2e6ad183ef1e38f3f45d1a5f0)

You can see how they did everything they could just to get rid of me so I don't bother them and just forget that I payed almost a grand and never got what I payed for.

To summarize it - turned out that they don't sell the photo frames that were in my £947 box, which means there was no mix up at their side. They want me to return the laptop I have never received in order to refund me?! When i mentioned that the laptop is most probably stolen by some of the delivery guys, they are all like ""it was delivered by amazon delivery, our system says the item was delivered"" - and they just ignore the fact, that the box with their label was delivered, but the laptop I paid for was not in the box! 

**Wait - it's getting better:**

When I say that it is not my job, to investigate who stole the laptop from their delivery system, all they repeat is ""call the police"", saying that I have to investigate an item I paid for but never received, ignoring all the UK and EU rules about online shopping.

**And the cherry on top of all:**

**They would absolutely not share the serial number or the mac address of the laptop I paid for and never got! So when I go to the police later today I can't even tell them which laptop was stolen, as I have never seen it, and amazon absolutely refuses to identify it, but is still keeping the money I paid for it!**

Some deductive thinking:

The seller is Amazon and the delivery was made by Amazon deliveries (no third party is involved whatsoever), so someone between the Amazon Warehouse and the delivery guy must have the knowledge there is laptop inside, and be prepared with similar shape and weight objects to swap it. Also must have the time and lack of cameras to do it, so all this leads me to the conclusion someone within the deliveries or the warehouse packaging did the swap.

I have payed for it with my Curve card, which has some buyer protection. Contacted them already, hopefully they will do the chargeback but it's been 2 days already and I haven't heard from them (and their buyer protection is supposed to take 1 day...)

Conclusion - 

**When you order something valuable OPEN THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU SIGN FOR IT!**

That would save a lot of time and headaches if i just took the 20 seconds to open it before i sign for it.

&#x200B;

Also - are there any similar cases - laptops supposed to be delivered by amazon swapped with something and which areas in UK were they?

**#####################UPDATE FROM CURVE##############**

     Please note that, we can attempt to raise a chargeback on your behalf, however, it is possible that this will be rejected by the merchant, as Amazon will be able to provide proof that goods have been delivered and signed for. 

Anyone knows if I have better chance of disputing the chance trough Curve or trough the Bank (Lloyds) ?

This went viral i guess. **Twitter blocked my account** for ""unusual activity"". While I was sleeping. Going from few followers to 500 retweets while you sleep is indeed unusual

\### **Update - 19th 10am - ANOTHER CHAT WITH THE SUPPORT** \- ########

I decided to try again to resolve this in a civilized way, so I contacted the support again - some people here suggested if you try more CS representatives, sometimes you get lucky and some are more helpful than others. I guess I was not that lucky as this was pretty much the same shit as before. At the end they just closed the chat...

\########### **Update - 19th afternoon** \- ################

This became shitstorm over the internet - someone from amazon saw it I guess so they **called me and told me they will process my refund today**. At this point I will believe it when I see it. At the same time I received an email from curve that they processed the chargeback. Now I have to chase them to stop the chargeback lol. This whole thing probably cost me same mount I lost dealing with this instead of working.

I will properly organize the thread chronologically when I get the chance and write the lessons learned. It looks it's not just me, and **unless you make a sh\*tstorm on the social media, they just f\*ck with you**, there are stories in the comments way worse than mine :/

&#x200B;

\########### **Update - 19th late afternoon** \- ################

Curve messaged me promptly they will hold back the chargeback to give chance amazon to do the right thing.So far OK support from Curve. No sign of refund from Amazon.

good sad coz i got lucky with you retweeting me but good as there are obviously good people over there that want to help you but its hard to reach them and they are definetely not in their chat you want to talk on the phone with real people advice chat as quickly as possible so you bypass the chat then you recieve email did the chat solve your problem click no and then click do you want us to call you you have way better chances to get to talk with someone who can actually help if you see the person on the phone is one of these is there anything else there is no point of reasoning with them waste of time and good energy just hang up and repeat the whole chat no phone thing it is annoying but not everyone gets lucky his thread to become viral i know it was mentioned already but if you buy something expensive open the box before you sign there may be warehouse mixup thief driver bad people raid the van while driver delivers all kind of variables that are very hard to be prevented even if you are a trilion dollar company with ai and everything so take these extra seconds check the box and save yourself weeks of head in the wall moments trying to get your money back curve support is ok i dealt with them on few occasions before they are slow but helpful if you show them you posted your issue on a very visible place they are way faster this is the same sad and good as in point sadly the way to resolve your issues fast and efficiently is to cry on social it is very annoying and kind of looks like people blackmailing businesses but between the choice of losing a grand and be annoying crying person i think most would choose the latter thread reordered chronologically latest updates are at the bottom full story so far on nov th black friday i ordered an asus laptop worth i have paid and got notified i will get it monday great i have been ordering from amazon since and i never had any issues if they say i will get it in days i know i will on monday afternoon dec nd i happily signed for the box the delivery guy got me and continued my work i noticed the box was a bit lighter than i expected and thought great this laptop is even lighter than i thought i dont like heavy laptops when i opened the box a bit later there was the first bitter surprise instead of a laptop inside the amazon box were photo frames my laptop ok this happens i will just contact amazon and they will fix this they are big black friday is their busiest day in the year its only human to make a mistake so i contact their customer support they apologize that model is already sold out and they can only refund me its fine i say they assure me i will get refund the moment i return the box with the wrong item sent and just to print the hermes label and send it back helloim sorry to hear of the mix up with your orderfirstly please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused by this situationnormally in this situation id create a replacement order for the incorrect item right away to be sent to you as soon as possible at no additional chargeunfortunately at the moment this item is unavailable from our suppliers and we cant send a replacement however well be happy to issue a refundplease return the wrong item to us and well refund you as soon as possibleplease click on the following link to be brought to your personalised return label and follow the instructions provided as a good customer i print the label i go to the local hermes and i send back the one pound worth photo frames i guess their process is automated so they need that for easy process well they have been delivering to me for years the least i can do is do that minute trip and i wait waited a week no news i check and they received my return just days after i sent it no notification nothing so i contacted them to see when i will receive the immediate refund i was promised which led to probably the most frustrating chat i had with customer service in my life attaching the screenshots of the chat amazon tries everything to get rid of me and theres no way i get my money back so im paying for something i never received and i cant even have its serial number or mac address so i provide it to the police you can see how they did everything they could just to get rid of me so i dont bother them and just forget that i payed almost a grand and never got what i payed for to summarize it turned out that they dont sell the photo frames that were in my box which means there was no mix up at their side they want me to return the laptop i have never received in order to refund me when i mentioned that the laptop is most probably stolen by some of the delivery guys they are all like it was delivered by amazon delivery our system says the item was delivered and they just ignore the fact that the box with their label was delivered but the laptop i paid for was not in the box wait its getting better when i say that it is not my job to investigate who stole the laptop from their delivery system all they repeat is call the police saying that i have to investigate an item i paid for but never received ignoring all the uk and eu rules about online shopping and the cherry on top of all they would absolutely not share the serial number or the mac address of the laptop i paid for and never got so when i go to the police later today i cant even tell them which laptop was stolen as i have never seen it and amazon absolutely refuses to identify it but is still keeping the money i paid for it some deductive thinking the seller is amazon and the delivery was made by amazon deliveries no third party is involved whatsoever so someone between the amazon warehouse and the delivery guy must have the knowledge there is laptop inside and be prepared with similar shape and weight objects to swap it also must have the time and lack of cameras to do it so all this leads me to the conclusion someone within the deliveries or the warehouse packaging did the swap i have payed for it with my curve card which has some buyer protection contacted them already hopefully they will do the chargeback but its been days already and i havent heard from them and their buyer protection is supposed to take day conclusion when you order something valuable open the package before you sign for it that would save a lot of time and headaches if i just took the seconds to open it before i sign for it xb also are there any similar cases laptops supposed to be delivered by amazon swapped with something and which areas in uk were they update from curve please note that we can attempt to raise a chargeback on your behalf however it is possible that this will be rejected by the merchant as amazon will be able to provide proof that goods have been delivered and signed for anyone knows if i have better chance of disputing the chance trough curve or trough the bank lloyds xb update th early morning this went viral i guess twitter blocked my account for unusual activity while i was sleeping going from few followers to retweets while you sleep is indeed unusual update th am another chat with the support i decided to try again to resolve this in a civilized way so i contacted the support again some people here suggested if you try more cs representatives sometimes you get lucky and some are more helpful than others i guess i was not that lucky as this was pretty much the same shit as before at the end they just closed the chat xb another attempt to resolve it with cs same result xb anita admits they didnt do anything so far but is there anything else apart from this update th afternoon this became shitstorm over the internet someone from amazon saw it i guess so they called me and told me they will process my refund today at this point i will believe it when i see it at the same time i received an email from curve that they processed the chargeback now i have to chase them to stop the chargeback lol this whole thing probably cost me same mount i lost dealing with this instead of working i will properly organize the thread chronologically when i get the chance and write the lessons learned it looks its not just me and unless you make a shtstorm on the social media they just fck with you there are stories in the comments way worse than mine xb update th late afternoon curve messaged me promptly they will hold back the chargeback to give chance amazon to do the right thingso far ok support from curve no sign of refund from amazon i waited weeks for someone to notice me i will wait a bit longer i cant possibly unblock my twitter and i can not possibly see the reason behind its block new to twitter so may be theres something im missing,-1,-1_to_and_bill_the,negative,0.6093927025794983,optimism,0.3612380623817444

Reddit,"UK bright future? [Discussion]. I made this comment in response to someone complaining about the status of UK. I see this being a quite prevalent opinion so I thought about making a proper post to showcase what is actually going on and to hear your opinion on the matter.

Disclaimer: My opinion is that UK has a bright future ahead in spite of Brexit not because of it. I personally think that with all the advantages UK would've been able to influence the EU much more from the inside and shape it into something great.

Anyway, here we go:

1. UK is expected to become one of the richest countries in europe in the coming years. [Go to 2028 and have a look](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) at gdp per capita.
2. [Taxes are some of the lowest in EU](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=AWCOMP) and will remain there because of the next point[(if you find it hard to read check this ss I took)](https://imgur.com/a/wLUS2Br)
3. Demographics are awful in most of europe compared to [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom). Just check that inverted pyramid in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany) or worse in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Italy)....
4. UK [still second place in soft-power ranking](https://brandfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GSPS-2024-Social-Media-Post.jpg) just behind the US.
5. UK [remains the tech/financial ""mecca""](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-helped-britain-keep-euro-clearing-london-brexit/) of europe despite what everyone was hoping.
6. Housing. Yes London is expensive but a flat in Glasgow (a city of 1.8 million)  [is about 50k...](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/144632381#/?channel=RES_BUY) So if you work remote you can pay 300 for a mortgage after a 5k down payment.
7. [Second most innovative large* country in the world](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Most-Innovative-Countries_11142023.png)
8. Just look at these other headlines:

>Both Spain and France have called for an end to the 90-day rule, saying that it is negatively affecting their economies. The two countries have many second homes that are owned by Britons – and as Brits aren’t able to spend so much time in those homes, they aren’t able to spend so much money locally.

The mood in the UK is pretty down with plenty of problems, wont deny any of that. But man, its so much worse anywhere else at the moment...

Reddit,"Adopt a Genius - Help my guy find his way. I have seen many wonderful things here that have really moved me, and so I am asking you for help. My boyfriend is a truly astonishing man. He studied pure maths at Cambridge, and can learn any skill he puts his mind to. Unfortunately he is soon to be out of a job, despite trying everything. He puts it down to one thing - before he met me he was too autistic to forge bonds and network with people who would benefit him in later life. He has now studied people and behaviours, and has become a lovely, charming guy who I adore with everything I have. The choices he made as an academic in his earlier years have meant he is left in a somewhat specialised field, but he can do so much! He taught himself 4 programming languages in order to broaden his fields, but his specialised background means he just isn't being considered. If you would like a computer engineer, with a background in maths, algorithms, game theory and multi-agent systems, who is very interested in AI (amongst other things) who can make apps and website design, as well as being a black belt in Wing Tsung, a cracking dancer and an all round awesome person, would you give him a chance?

Reddit,"DAE want to discuss and criticise the Online Safety Act?. So I need to talk about this Act. It has been 2 days since it has passed and it's already caused a lot of upheaval amongst UK citizens. This situation is deeply troubling — I’ve even had to use a VPN just to bypass the extremely stringent geo restrictions. 

For those that don't know, the Online Safety Act 2025 - which applies to the entirety of the UK - is as follows:

*""As of 25 July 2025, platforms have a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms are now required to use highly effective age assurance to prevent children from accessing pornography, or content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorder content.*

*Platforms must also prevent children from accessing other harmful and age-inappropriate content such as bullying, hateful content and content which encourages dangerous stunts or ingesting dangerous substances. Platforms must also provide parents and children with clear and accessible ways to report problems online when they do arise.""*

*Here's my thoughts on why the Act looks good on paper, but is poorly executed in practice and my criticisms that I have.*





\~ Why the Act is good (on paper) \~

I think that the intention of the OSA is beneficial and beyond important. It protects kids from having access to pornographic content, things that they shouldn't really see, and that they're deconstructing the blatantly exploitative porn industry (through no longer contributing to the exploitation, brutalisation, and abuse of women) and preventing kids from becoming addicted to and picking things up (like misogyny or treating women like commodities / objects), which is **CRUCIAL AND ESSENTIAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE.**



\~ Creative Freedom, Survivors, and Emotional Lifelines Under Threat \~

However, from my perspective, now it's extremely difficult for me to get access to mental health subreddits so I can vent and get advice, because now, anything deemed ""mature"" or ""NSFW"" is restricted and ID-gated (including this website), and doing creative writing through these chatbots (which I have been doing for the past few months or so, but not for porn or anything like that - I use it for comfort, venting, meeting my emotional needs rather than sexual, exploring certain dynamics - giant x tiny, roleplaying based on given scenarios, worldbuilding for my OCs) and it's both infuriating and tragic, because writers and artists - websites with drawing references are also being censored - are effectively being legislated away, lumped up, and torn away who need those tools for emotional safety, comfort, creative expression, etc because they are caught in the crossfire - myself included.

From what I've seen on TikTok, some subreddits like the r/sexualassault subreddit - advice and a meaningful, tolerant, safe, trauma-informed space for SURVIVORS of sexual assault, are being completely restricted by arbitrary ID checks that get outsourced to third party verification firms in countries like the USA, which is just entirely backwards and poses a huge risk of data breaches, whilst also potentially goes against the DPA 2018 (\*\*Data Protection Act 2018\*\*) and RIPA 2000 (\*\*Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\*\*).

Not only that, it could potentially go against **Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights** — freedom of expression, which this legislation may violate through overbroad content censorship.

Literally EVERYTHING with the littlest of NSFW content is being censored, including **mental health support groups**, **LGBTQIA+ content**, **survivor and trauma stories**, war crimes in **Gaza / Palestine** and the newly developing **Thailand-Cambodia conflict (which as of writing this has ended),** meaning the whole thing is poorly executed - extremely.

It SHUTS down victims and discourages already marginalised groups of people - whether that be neurodivergent folks, LGBTQIA+ / Queer people, people in MH crisis and those with complex trauma, victims of sexual assault / child sexual abuse / rape / child-on-child sexual assault - as well as a plethora of other groups from having access to lifelines and processing their trauma and regulating emotions through exploring dark themes - myself included.



\~ The Economic Monopoly and Late-Capitalist Consumerism: Crushing Small Platforms \~

It really is terrifying if you think about it as well. The UK proposes to become a global technological hub whilst simultaneously building a digital iron curtain around itself.

This whole thing also effectively **monopolises high-tech / big tech companies that can actually AFFORD the legal infrastructure in the first place**, whilst small companies (like JanitorAI and others), get crushed underfoot under legal pressure - I'm sure your aware that they can be fined £18mn in breaches of non-compliance, which supports late-capitalist consumerism and it leans heavily towards classist logic in the form of ""eat the rich, fuck the poor"", essentially digital gentrification.



\~ Political perspectives : Echoes of Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Communism / Fascism, Laissez-Faire Leadership Styles, and Dystopian Narratives / Dichotomies \~

The fact that the petition on parliament has over **200,000 SIGNATURES** and the UK government - Labour (who many see as Conservatives but in red) - **STILL HAVEN'T RESPONDED** speaks volumes about their blatantly **laissez-faire and hedonistic rulership style.** They don't care about the citizens or child safety.

This may sound extreme, but the pattern is deeply unsettling: mass censorship, silencing dissent, and marginalised groups being punished for existing online. These are not just features of dystopian fiction—they’re hallmarks of early authoritarian and totalitarian systems throughout history - and people are comparing it to the likes of Nazi Germany, The USSR / Soviet Union, China, and North Korea.

It really is a slippery slope, and it eerily echoes narratives in dystopian fiction - **1984, The Hunger Games with Panem, and The Handmaid's Tale. This whole situation is honestly just giving just that, and the silence from leadership speaks volumes—and it's a silence that endangers lives.**

**Not only that, it also seems to set up this whole rhetoric or dichotomy / binary opposition where you're either a child that needs to be protected or a perverse child predator - and that is indescribably absurd because it's essentially the same as ""guilty until proven innocent"" or ""suspicious until proven otherwise"", which just completely goes against the legal system we have in the UK.**

**And I also hate that people are generalising those who use VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions as porn addicts - which is true but at the same time it is very dehumanising. It isn't just about porn.**



**\~** Why It Actually Endangers Children More \~

Whilst on the topic of child predators, the OSA does very ironically the **EXACT OPPOSITE** of protecting children from accessing porn and NSFW content. This whole act, whilst the intention is great, does not distract from the fact that it increases the chances of child predators getting into spaces where there are children (because the ID verification firms aforementioned use AI and can be easily bypassed - which are deeply flawed, unreliable, and cost-prohibitive — failing the very purpose they claim to serve), people accessing dodgy websites with criminal and beyond disgusting / criminal / illegal activity, and let's not forget how it increases the incidence of **revenge porn and CSAM** as it pushes users into hidden, unregulated corners of the internet by making it harder to spot and report predators who exploit these gaps, and by increasing stigma and silence, which makes victims less likely to seek help or come forward.

Hell, even people are using **Tor browser** to bypass the geo-restrictions, which is used to go the **DARK WEB** keep in mind.

\~ Concerns for the future \~

This Online Safety Act that has now been enforced honestly just seems like a huge legal, ethical, moral, geo-political disaster waiting to happen coded up under the thin veneer of language relating to child safety.

I am deeply ashamed and appalled by the state that the government is in.

And not only that, other countries like Australia and the EU are trying to adopt the same type of legislations in the next upcoming months. And it needs to be called out. We deserve better than this.

Reddit,"Why the NHS in England is really failing.. I’m a senior doctor in the NHS, and if there’s one thing I’ve learnt, it’s that the issues we’re facing aren’t the result of frontline staff failing to roll up their sleeves and trying their very best. Rather, much of the chaos, stress, and endless crises we read about daily can be traced back to a series of decisions made by the senior leadership team in NHS England (NHSE). These leadership choices have rippled across every trust, every specialism, and nearly every colleague I’ve met, shaping the daily experience of doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals in ways that are often detrimental to patient care. It is the NHS England leadership who either lobby Government for particular policies or are tasked with turning Government policy into reality and yet they are never held accountable and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care catches a disproportionate amount of the flak.

**1. The 2016 Contract and the Erosion of Continuity of Care**

Back in 2016, a new contract was imposed on resident doctors which was marketed (at least to the public) as an upgrade that would introduce a “seven-day NHS” and ensure consistent coverage throughout weekends. In practice, this was more about political optics than genuine improvement of patient outcomes. From my perspective, the most tangible change was that doctors suddenly found themselves spread more thinly across more days, with rota patterns becoming more erratic.

One of the greatest casualties of this new arrangement has been continuity of care. Previously, teams were more stable. You’d have a consultant, registrar, senior house officer, and foundation doctor all working in tandem, often on a more predictable pattern. This allowed them to get to know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, to trust each other’s clinical judgements, and – crucially – to follow a cohort of patients through their admission, investigations, and treatments in a more cohesive manner. Patients benefited immensely from the stability of seeing familiar faces, and the medical teams built better rapport with them over time.

After 2016, rotas were rejigged in the name of “efficiency,” with doctors spread out to ensure coverage for more days and more shift patterns. Whilst it might look good on a spreadsheet to have so many doctors rostered every day of the week, in practice it means patients are likely to see different doctors from one day to the next. As a result, the subtle nuances in a patient’s history can slip through the cracks. When I’m picking up a patient on the acute take whom I’ve never met before, and whose last review was by a completely different doctor on a different shift, there’s a real risk that vital details get lost in translation. It’s not that electronic patient records and handovers aren’t helpful; it’s that no system can replace the familiarity and context gained from following your patients day by day.

Is this the fault of doctors? Not at all. We’re simply following the rota patterns allocated. The more fundamental issue is the design. And that design was orchestrated at the highest level by NHSE leadership, who prioritised a shiny political pledge over the realities of team-based medicine. Who were these leaders? **Sir Bruce Keogh** the then national medical director [who was politicised](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/junior-doctors-whitehall-officials-edited-letter-from-independent-medic-to-build-hardedged-case-against-strike-a6801501.html) for the benefit of the Government of the day. **Sir Simon Stevens** who [enforced the imposition of this new contract](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/02/junior-doctors-contract-statement/) dismissing the concerns raised by doctors and effectively ending negotiations. **Danny Mortimer** head of NHS Employers who lead the contract negotiations. **Charlie Massey** who was director general and advisor to Jeremy Hunt was then [appointed CEO of the GMC](https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/16/doctors-embroiled-in-another-dispute-over-one-of-jeremy-hunts-aides-6010582/), the doctor's regulator, and now also regulates Physician Associates.

**2. The Decline in Ward-Based Teaching**

Another insidious effect of these contractual and rota changes has been the steady decline in the quality of ward-based teaching. In a system that’s perennially short-staffed, it’s all too common for planned teaching sessions to be cancelled at the last minute because of service pressures. Moreover, when teaching does go ahead, it’s increasingly dedicated to what many of us would call “soft” subjects. Instead of diving into in-depth clinical topics like chronic kidney disease management, pharmacology of drugs used in parkinsons disease, or the latest use of immunological therapies in autoimmune conditions, we’re herded into sessions on “resilience” and “leadership.”

Now, I’m not suggesting that resilience or leadership are entirely without merit. Doctors do need to know how to manage stress, work with teams, and navigate complicated interpersonal dynamics. However, the pendulum has swung so far in the direction of these generic sessions that we’re missing out on the bread-and-butter clinical teachings that are vital to our competence. It is through competence and confidence that doctors will feel more resilient in the face of overwhelming sick patients. Ward-based teaching has always been one of the best ways to learn because it’s relevant, patient-centred, and practical. But the reality is that consultants are under such immense pressure to clear wards, handle overflowing clinics, and meet targets that there’s little time to do comprehensive bedside teaching for residents. The ward round becomes a fragmented task and finish rush rather than a learning opportunity.

This is a shared experience up and down the entire country which can only be ascribed to national directive and another example of NHSE’s leadership pushing for throughput without properly considering the knock-on effects. They’ll issue edicts and guidelines about the importance of leadership and resilience, but they fail to protect time and resources for the fundamental clinical teaching that’s crucial for safe patient care. If you think things are bad now, you're in for a shock in 5-10 years time when standards will plummet even faster. [Read this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1b9xymj/fellow_med_regs_its_out_of_hours_and_a_patient/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the doctor's reddit - we are now in the ludicrous position where serious and time critical interventions like chest drains are just not being taught to doctors with many expecting not to learn the skill even by the time they are consultants.

**3. The Disruptive Nature of Rotational Training**

One of the toughest aspects of training in the NHS – especially as a resident doctor – is the constant rotation between different departments, hospitals, or trusts. Typically, you might rotate every 4, 6, or 12 months, depending on your training pathway. The logic behind this system is superficial in theory: by rotating, resident doctors can gain a wide range of experiences and specialities, broadening their skill sets and understanding of medicine. However, the disruption this causes in team cohesion, patient care, and even mundane organisational processes can’t be overstated.

Every time a doctor moves to a new rotation, they face a steep learning curve:

* Getting to know a whole new set of colleagues, from consultants and registrars down to nurses, ward clerks, and healthcare assistants. It is commonplace for entire teams to never even learn the names of each other. If you can't even be bothered to learn the name of each other, can you imagine how bothered you are to teach them the skills necessary to develop?

* Learning the physical layout of the new hospital, which can be labyrinthine. (There’s nothing quite like being bleary-eyed at 3am and utterly lost between wards because a sign for “Ward 14B” was missing.)

* Discovering the local policies and protocols, which vary surprisingly even within the same trust. One hospital might require you to book emergency theatre slots (CEPOD) via an online form, another might insist you bleep the on-call anaesthetist, and sometimes it's left unsaid who is responsible for liaising with a theatre manager which you can imagine causes operational chaos.

This lack of standardisation across trusts and even across departments within the same trust can lead to delays in patient care. In an ideal world, there’d be national policies with clear, uniform guidelines on how to do something as critical as arranging an urgent theatre slot. Instead, you have local idiosyncrasies that waste time and can put patients at risk.

As if that weren’t bad enough, rotational training also means that just as you start to gel with your team, you’re whisked away to another department. The result is a perpetual sense of upheaval and less invested team dynamics. Strong teams depend on trust and familiarity – intangible qualities that build over time. By forcing doctors to move on before that trust can fully cement, we end up with a series of disjointed groups that never quite learn to function at their best.

The British Medical Association (BMA) have frequently and consistently asked for better training to make more efficient and productive doctors and this includes the infamous 2008 vote where they lobbied to cap the intake of students and ban new medical schools from opening. The more cynical commentators often cite this as typical protectonism to limit supply but the [sensible arguments are there for all to see](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a748#:~:text=Delegates%20at%20the%20annual%20BMA%20conference%20voted%20by,a%20complete%20ban%20on%20opening%20new%20medical%20schools) and indeed are [being proven today by the mass doctor unemployment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68849847). The BMA has consistently asked for improvements, whether that’s prioritising clinical teaching, better induction processes, or uniform protocols across trusts. But the evidence is clear that the decision making and leadership of NHS England has been in direct conflict with the consultants who used to lead services and the experiences of resident doctors and look where that has brought us but more importantly I'll show you where this is about to take us.

**4. Strikes, the Annual Winter Crisis, Morale and Retention**

Every winter, we hear about the NHS being on the brink. We see photos of patients stuck on trolleys in corridors, wait times rocketing, and discharges delayed. For some reason, NHSE leadership will seize on the nearest explanation that absolves them of responsibility as if Winter is an unpredictable event. NHS England's [**Chris Hopson** blamed increased demand on flu and covid in 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64142614) rather than identifying the issues on capacity and providing solutions. Recently, they’ve pointed their fingers at strike action, implying that the workforce’s decision to withdraw labour was unreasonable and triggered the crisis, as if they were unaware of the year on year results of the [National NHS Staff Survey](https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/static/8fce170a75e46bc5b531253d2966c04b/National-Results-Briefing-2023-V3.pdf) showing only 69% think their immediate manager works together to come to a shared understanding of problems, 54% were satisfied with the recognition they get for good work, 33% felt that their work was valued, 31% were satisfied with pay, 51% felt involved in deciding on changes, 55% feel able to make improvements happen, 50% were confident that their organisation would address their concerns, and 46% feel able to meet the demands put on them.

But if you compare the timeline, these crises occur year after year, well before any mention of industrial action. Even in 2025, which saw no major strikes at crucial junctures, we had a winter crisis that rivalled previous years. The pattern is clear: [The absolute number of GPs has fallen by 12% in the last 14 years](https://x.com/DrSteveTaylor/status/1880029281348173894/photo/1), the bottlenecks in A&E, the lack of social care support for step-down discharges, and the chronic underinvestment in infrastructure don’t spontaneously emerge because of a few strike days. They are structural and longstanding.

Strikes, as disruptive as they may appear from the outside, are a symptom of deeper dysfunction, not the root cause. Doctors and other healthcare workers don’t strike lightly. They do so because they’ve exhausted other avenues for achieving safe staffing levels, fair pay, and workable conditions that ultimately serve patients better. Yet NHSE’s leadership often opts to frame these strikes as reckless or as the singular culprit for all that ails the NHS, rather than confront the uncomfortable truth that the system’s design is fundamentally flawed.

  
The [NHS Long term workforce plan retention section ](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-2/#3-retain-embedding-the-right-culture-and-improving-retention)produces a fascinating rabbit hole that says an awful lot but does almost nothing. It talks about the ""NHS People Promise"" and links to ""[Retention hub: Looking after our people](https://www.england.nhs.uk/looking-after-our-people/)"" which links to ""[Improving staff retention: a guide for line managers and employers](https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/improving-staff-retention)"" which links to this [toolkit](https://www.nhsemployers.org/system/files/media/Do-OD-Team-Toolkit_0.pdf) which in the ""application"" slide for examples to use the [first link doesn't work](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/technologymls/cymraeg/resources/pdf/tools/Team_dev/Team%20Development%20Guide.pdf), [the second link is behind a pay wall](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_52.htm), [the third link cycles back round to policy-speake](https://www.leadershipacademy.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/NHSLeadership-LeadershipFramework-OrganisationalToolkit-TeamDevelopment.pdf) rather than concrete examples. Essentially it all boils down to, listen to your staff and be compassionate. But that is never translated into reality because there are no real examples of how to do this for managers and there is a culture set by the leaders of NHS England to not listen to their staff but to protect the reputation and integrity of the brand the ""NHS"".

**5. NHSE Leadership’s Silence on Real Issues and Diversionary Tactics**

The most galling aspect of NHSE’s leadership, in my opinion, is how selective they can be with their activism. When a crisis is unfolding every winter in our hospitals, with staff stretched beyond capacity and patients receiving suboptimal care, we often hear very little from the top ranks. The National Medical Director and other high-profile figures often provide generic soundbites urging staff to “pull together” or promising to “review the data.”

Yet, when it comes to the policies they actively promote and the paper trail leads squarely to their feet which are under criticism by doctors en masse sounding the alarm bell, they suddenly find their voice. A recent example is the coordinated response to a poorly written article in The Times, which criticised the debate around physician associates (PAs) and how toxic it had become on social media. NHS England’s leadership jumped on this, issuing statements about the need for civility and respect in debate. Here you can see the National Medical Director at NHSE [**Steven Powis**'s post on X](https://x.com/NHSEnglandNMD/status/1880624358017974409) and Chief Workforce officer [**Navina Evans**' post on X](https://x.com/NavinaEvans/status/1880606698202898602). Both posts are filled with responses from the public and doctors alike pulling apart the article in The Times and providing evidence and context that is conveniently left out.

Let’s be clear: civility is important. No one wants a rancorous, abusive conversation dominating professional circles. However, there’s a glaring problem here. The underlying issue with the deployment of PAs isn’t whether doctors are being polite enough in their discussions; it’s that these professionals, as they currently stand, are comparatively undertrained, and are being used as a substitute for fully qualified doctors in some settings. This can undermine the quality of care that patients receive and places an unfair burden on the PAs themselves, who aren’t equipped with the same level of clinical experience as doctors yet are expected to shoulder significant responsibilities.

The fact that NHSE leadership coordinated a rapid response to defend the introduction of PAs, but remains conspicuously reticent on the core complaints behind ongoing winter crises or the eroding quality of training, speaks volumes about their priorities. Rather than addressing the legitimate concerns – which range from the safety implications of substituting doctors with less trained staff, to how this shift might exacerbate existing staffing shortages by diluting the workforce structure – they focus on condemning the “toxic debate.” It’s an exercise in misdirection that doesn’t solve any of the real problems. The whole experiment of associate professionals is laced with outrageous lies, deceptions, and espionage which continues to incite the medical profession. For example, there was [a request on 20th November 2023](https://x.com/drmattuk/status/1746156700669714771) for an extraordinary general meeting of the Royal College of Physicians to debate and revalaute the role of PAs after it was discovered that PAs had been misleading colleagues and patients about their role, thousands of illegal prescriptions had been written, and mass amounts of ionising radiation requests had been made against the law. The EGM was supposed to happen within 8 weeks as per the rules of the Royal College however it actually occurred on 13th March 2025, conveniently after a parliamentary debate scheduled on 17th January 2024. In attendance **Professor Steven Powis**, National Medical Director, who has no elected role in the RCP, was offered the opportunity to answer questions directly by the chair, then president **Dr Sarah Clarke** who had to [subsequently resign in disgrace](https://www.rcp.ac.uk/news-and-media/news-and-opinion/prcp-resignation-arrangements-confirmed/). It has since [come out that NHS England national leaders coordinated a series of communications and press releases around the delayed RCP events](https://x.com/djnicholl/status/1880649732055597056) in order to influence the debate abusing their positions of power rather than their equal positions as Fellows of the Royal College. Most egregiously though was [the presentation of the survey data that was so misrepresented and skewed ](https://x.com/ShaunLintern/status/1769669041256276278)that it lead to the [resignation of the registrar](https://www.rcp.ac.uk/news-and-media/news-and-opinion/rcp-registrar-steps-down-after-3-years-in-post#:~:text=In%20her%20letter%20to%20fellows%20and%20members%2C%20she%20said%3A&text='As%20a%20result%2C%20I%20made,May%20this%20year%2C%20as%20planned).

  
For those of you who want to see the EGM, it was [recorded and posted on youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Qu6BKDy98&feature=youtu.be). If you do choose to watch it, ask yourself is this the toxic debate that is being painted?

**6. Physician Associates: A Symptom of a Larger Workforce Problem**

The introduction of PAs into the NHS could have been a boon if done thoughtfully. There’s undoubtedly a role for physician associates to complement medical teams, helping with tasks that free up doctors for more complex work. Indeed both[ the BMA](https://www.bma.org.uk/media/tkcosjt1/maps-scope-of-practice2024-web.pdf) and [the RCP](https://www.rcp.ac.uk/media/tzahqplo/pa_interim-guidance-on-scope-of-practice.pdf) have published scopes of practice that doctors are asking for help with. Instead, we’re seeing trust after trust recruiting PAs to plug the gaps in rotas whilst simultaneously [NHSE Leadership say ""PAs are not a substitute for doctors""](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-englands-position-on-physician-associates-7-february-2024/#:~:text=PAs%20are%20not%20a%20substitute,be%20supervised%20appropriately%20by%20doctors). NHS England leadership has got itself wrapped up in its own lies saying one thing but demonstrably doing another. When the leadership lie like this and can't be honest about issues, solutions, and strategies, they will never ever be able to deliver positive outcomes. A policy that can't stand up to scrutiny and has to be obscured by lies is not a policy worth having. But it's not just the NHSE leadership, it's also the previous DHSC advisor to Jeremy Hunt, now CEO of the GMC, **Charlie Massey** who is in a tangle. [Originally the GMC said it would be for the Royal Colleges to set scope](https://x.com/gmcuk/status/1719722673012359269) but then once they had, they backtracked over [concerns that PAs wouldn't be employed](https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/gmc-response-on-rcgp-pa-guidance-06-08-2024_pdf-109476158.pdf). The regulator of course not being an employer but an institution that should be upholding standards. It is difficult to conclude anything else but that the regulator has been captured by political and institutional interests in pursuing the PA agenda.

The answer is depressingly simple. Doctors have been leaving the NHS in droves, driven away by burnout, inadequate pay progression, punishing working conditions, and a training structure that’s chaotic and lacking in continuity. Rather than honestly confronting these failings, NHSE’s leadership has decided it’s simpler and cheaper to introduce a new cadre of staff in direct conflict with doctors' roles. Again, from the vantage point of a spreadsheet, you can see how it might look like a smart solution. But from the vantage point of a ward, it’s a short-sighted fix that could jeopardise patient safety and further demoralise doctors who see their roles being devalued.

**7. Where Does Responsibility Lie?**

In many respects, the Government is ultimately accountable for setting budgets, national policy, and legislation around healthcare. So there’s no denying that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Treasury have crucial roles to play. However, NHSE’s leadership doesn’t get to shirk its share of the blame. They are the ones tasked with executing policy, drafting the frameworks for trusts to follow, and implementing changes to contracts, rotas, and workforce planning. When doctors complain en masse about unsafe staffing or the decimation of continuity of care, the leadership could – if they had the will – use their influence to advocate for meaningful reforms. Afterall, any effective policy needs buy-in from the people on the ground who will be the ones implementing and delivering it.

Unfortunately, we’ve seen time and again how NHSE’s leadership has either stayed silent or offered only cosmetic tweaks. Consider the following:

* **Continued rota gaps**: Instead of genuinely negotiating the working patterns in the 2016 contract to ensure safer staffing, NHSE imposed the contract and allowed many trusts to rely on goodwill from exhausted staff and forcibly stab them in the back [denying doctors leave for life changing events like weddings or even exams necessary for career progression.](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/one-of-us-couldnt-even-get-leave-to-go-to-their-own-weddin-283544/)

* **Inadequate teaching support**: They issue edicts about needing more “in-situ simulation” and “interprofessional learning,” yet do little to ease the service pressures that crowd out teaching time.

* **Deflection on strikes**: NHSE leaders could have taken the lead in addressing staff concerns at an early stage, potentially averting strike action. Instead, they focus on public messaging that frames staff as obstructive. [Multiple times the Government refused to come to the negotiation table](https://news.sky.com/story/health-secretary-refuses-to-negotiate-with-junior-doctors-until-strikes-called-off-13035494) and [yet NHS leaders kept blaming both sides](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/nhs-junior-doctors-strike-appointments-emergency-b2356367.html).

* **Neglecting structural issues**: From the disjointed rotation system to the glaring lack of standardisation across trusts, these are the sorts of large-scale organisational problems that national leadership could work to standardise or improve. But we continue to languish under disparate policies that cause daily inefficiencies.

**8. The Human Cost**

It’s important to remember that these leadership decisions have a very real human cost. When continuity of care breaks down, patients suffer. They might have to retell their stories multiple times, or experience delays in investigations. Sometimes, an important piece of information about their past medical history or social circumstances might not get passed along properly.

For doctors, the impact is just as profound. Our training suffers when ward-based clinical teaching is repeatedly cancelled or consultants don't feel invested in training resident doctors because they'll move on shortly. Our morale takes a hit when we’re constantly rotating, never staying long enough to form lasting relationships with our colleagues, or to see the fruits of our work with patients through to the end. Burnout escalates when the system feels more like an assembly line than a place of compassion and learning.

I’ve seen colleagues break down in tears at the end of gruelling shifts, convinced they’re failing because no one actually cares about them. They feel completely isolated, undervalued, and the system is designed to literally replace them in a matter of months all while they're dealing with death and life changing illnesses for the patients they care for. I’ve witnessed promising resident doctors question whether they should continue in the NHS at all, or pursue a career abroad where their labour is valued and their training supported. Each time someone hands in their notice or takes a break from training, it’s a small but significant crack in the foundation of our health service.

**9. What Needs to Happen**

If we genuinely want to address the problems in the NHS, we need to look squarely at the decisions coming from inside and at the top of NHS England itself. Here are a few suggestions that have been floated time and again by frontline staff and professional bodies, but have yet to be seriously tackled:

1. **Revisit the 2016 Contract**: Evaluate whether the purported benefits of spreading doctors more thinly have truly materialised. If they haven’t – and there’s mounting evidence they haven’t – revert or modify the contract to allow for better continuity of care.

1. **Protect Ward-Based Teaching**: Mandate and enforce policies that guarantee ring-fenced time for clinically focused teaching. Rebuild the team philosophy so that doctors are cared for by other staff. This must be recognised as service provision and an investment in more confident and competent staff who will be more proficient at treating patients in the future.

1. **Improve Rotational Structures**: Whilst rotating can provide some value, it shouldn’t be so frequent or so poorly planned that it undermines team cohesion and patient care. Standardise certain protocols across trusts to minimise the chaos of adjusting to new systems every few months. Finally bring in this fabled NHS passport that captures mandatory learning on which colour fire extinguisher should be used.

1. **Address Workforce Retention**: Instead of relying on quick fixes like PAs to fill gaps, double down on retaining qualified doctors by actually teaching them, increase the number of training posts and jobs available for career progression, competitive remuneration, and genuine psychological support from the consultants that they work with that goes beyond a token “resilience” workshop provided by some HR manager you'll never see again.

1. **Clarify the Role of Physician Associates**: If PAs are to be integrated into the NHS, they must have a well-defined scope of practice and adequate supervision. They should supplement, not replace, doctors. Listen to the doctors and use the BMA and RCP documents which are what are asking for help with.

1. **Transparency and Accountability**: NHSE leaders need to be transparent about the impact of their policies and be willing to share data openly. They should invite scrutiny of outcomes, rather than hiding behind carefully curated public statements that gloss over systemic failures. The public also need to take an interest in the individuals who are actually driving and implementing the policies that are leading to the failure of the NHS rather than solely blaming politicians.

**10. Looking Ahead**

We’re at a crossroads for the NHS. As each year goes by, the pressures intensify, more staff leave, and public satisfaction declines. The blame game becomes more fraught, and those in senior leadership sometimes appear more invested in protecting their reputations than in rectifying the root causes of these problems. Reforming the culture requires the right people with the right incentives and disincentives in the right place and we don't have any of those things because the leadership either doesn't have the political courage to be honest and be scrutinised, policy expertise to create a more productive framework, or operational abilities to deliver the kind of compassionate environment they apparently desire.

Yet, the NHS still has an extraordinary, dedicated workforce. Resident doctors, consultants, nurses, allied health professionals, support staff, and managers on the ground care deeply about their patients and about delivering high-quality care. They’ve proven this time and again, braving pandemics, winter pressures, and political upheavals. What they need, and what patients deserve, is senior leadership that has the courage to admit mistakes, reverse damaging policies, and engage honestly with those on the front lines to give them the tools they need.

If we want an NHS that’s fit for the next 75 years, we need to confront the elephant in the room: the senior leadership in NHSE must be held to account for decisions that have fundamentally altered the structure of medical work, eroded continuity of care, and diminished the training environment. We can’t keep plastering over the cracks and blaming crises on predictable demand, pretend that introducing physician associates will magically fill the void left by experienced doctor, nor giving the NHS more money when there are clear and obvious reforms that can improve working conditions and productivity.

True leadership isn’t about writing an article defending your chosen policies or issuing press releases in lockstep using contradictory terms like [""dependent... but can also work independently""](https://www.nhsemployers.org/system/files/2021-06/MAPs-Infographic-Physician-Associate.pdf) when the national conversation turns inconvenient. It’s about listening to feedback from the trenches, taking responsibility for missteps, and fighting for the resources and policy changes that will sustain both staff wellbeing and patient outcomes in the long run.

**Final Thoughts**

I know a rant on Reddit might not change the world overnight, but all too often conversations about the NHS boil down to ""it needs more money"" or ""it's a black hole for money"" or ""privatisation"" or ""too many managers"". I hope this post can spark a more specific conversation about some specific examples of the kinds of things that are going wrong and some solutions that could help as well as highlighting some of the irritating and frustrating circular logic that managers use. Many of us genuinely want to stay in the NHS and make it work. We believe in the principles of a healthcare system free at the point of need. But unless those at the top start owning up to their role in the slow-motion collapse we’re witnessing, it’s hard to be optimistic.

If you’re reading this and you’re part of that senior leadership, I challenge you to set aside the spin and politics, to step out onto the wards and clinics more regularly, and to speak with staff at every level. Hear what they’re saying about rotas, continuity of care, training, and workforce gaps. Acknowledge how poorly some of these initiatives – especially the 2016 contract changes – have served patients and staff. Re-read [The Tooke Report](https://www.baoms.org.uk/_userfiles/pages/files/professionals/mmc_final_report_revd_4jan.pdf) and ""The Role of The Doctor"" - most of us agree with that definition so equip us with the tools, actually build strong teams that stay and grow together in the spirit of excellence, and reap the dividends of a happy workforce. Then, and only then, can we begin to rebuild a system that actually lives up to the ideals upon which the NHS was founded.

Until that day comes, we’ll keep calling out the problems and hoping that, somewhere in the corridors of NHSE’s headquarters, someone is listening and willing to do something different. Because if we allow the current trajectory to continue, we risk losing the heart of the NHS altogether: the dedication and expertise of those who work within it, and the trust of those who depend upon its care.

learnt its that the issues were facing arent the result of frontline staff failing to roll up their sleeves and trying their very best rather much of the chaos stress and endless crises we read about daily can be traced back to a series of decisions made by the senior leadership team in nhs england nhse these leadership choices have rippled across every trust every specialism and nearly every colleague ive met shaping the daily experience of doctors nurses and allied health professionals in ways that are often detrimental to patient care it is the nhs england leadership who either lobby government for particular policies or are tasked with turning government policy into reality and yet they are never held accountable and the secretary of state for health and social care catches a disproportionate amount of the flak the contract and the erosion of continuity of care back in a new contract was imposed on resident doctors which was marketed at least to the public as an upgrade that would introduce a sevenday nhs and ensure consistent coverage throughout weekends in practice this was more about political optics than genuine improvement of patient outcomes from my perspective the most tangible change was that doctors suddenly found themselves spread more thinly across more days with rota patterns becoming more erratic one of the greatest casualties of this new arrangement has been continuity of care previously teams were more stable youd have a consultant registrar senior house officer and foundation doctor all working in tandem often on a more predictable pattern this allowed them to get to know each others strengths and weaknesses to trust each others clinical judgements and crucially to follow a cohort of patients through their admission investigations and treatments in a more cohesive manner patients benefited immensely from the stability of seeing familiar faces and the medical teams built better rapport with them over time after rotas were rejigged in the name of efficiency with doctors spread out to ensure coverage for more days and more shift patterns whilst it might look good on a spreadsheet to have so many doctors rostered every day of the week in practice it means patients are likely to see different doctors from one day to the next as a result the subtle nuances in a patients history can slip through the cracks when im picking up a patient on the acute take whom ive never met before and whose last review was by a completely different doctor on a different shift theres a real risk that vital details get lost in translation its not that electronic patient records and handovers arent helpful its that no system can replace the familiarity and context gained from following your patients day by day is this the fault of doctors

targets that theres little time to do comprehensive bedside teaching for residents the ward round becomes a fragmented task and finish rush rather than a learning opportunity this is a shared experience up and down the entire country which can only be ascribed to national directive and another example of nhses leadership pushing for throughput without properly considering the knockon effects theyll issue edicts and guidelines about the importance of leadership and resilience but they fail to protect time and resources for the fundamental clinical teaching thats crucial for safe patient care if you think things are bad now youre in for a shock in years time when standards will plummet even faster read this thread on the doctors reddit we are now in the ludicrous position where serious and time critical interventions like chest drains are just not being taught to doctors with many expecting not to learn the skill even by the time they are consultants the disruptive nature of rotational training one of the toughest aspects of training in the nhs especially as a resident doctor is the constant rotation between different departments hospitals or trusts typically you might rotate every or months depending on your training pathway the logic behind this system is superficial in theory by rotating resident doctors can gain a wide range of experiences and specialities broadening their skill sets and understanding of medicine however the disruption this causes in team cohesion patient care and even mundane organisational processes cant be overstated every time a doctor moves to a new rotation they face a steep learning curve getting to know a whole new set of colleagues from consultants and registrars down to nurses ward clerks and healthcare assistants it is commonplace for entire teams to never even learn the names of each other if you cant even be bothered to learn the name of each other can you imagine how bothered you are to teach them the skills necessary to develop learning the physical layout of the new hospital which can be labyrinthine theres nothing quite like being blearyeyed at am and utterly lost between wards because a sign for ward b was missing discovering the local policies and protocols which vary surprisingly even within the same trust one hospital might require you to book emergency theatre slots cepod via an online form another might insist you bleep the oncall anaesthetist and sometimes its left unsaid who is responsible for liaising with a theatre manager which you can imagine causes operational chaos this lack of standardisation across trusts and even across departments within the same trust can lead to delays in patient care in an ideal world thered be national policies with clear uniform guidelines on how to do something as critical as arranging an urgent theatre slot instead you have local idiosyncrasies that waste time and can put patients at risk as if that werent bad enough rotational training also means that just as you start to gel with your team youre whisked away to another department the result is a perpetual sense of upheaval and less invested team dynamics strong teams depend on trust and familiarity intangible qualities that build over time by forcing doctors to move on before that trust can fully cement we end up with a series of disjointed groups that never quite learn to function at their best the british medical association bma have frequently and consistently asked for better training to make more efficient and productive doctors and this includes the infamous vote where they lobbied to cap the intake of students and ban new medical schools from opening the more cynical commentators often cite this as typical protectonism to limit supply but the sensible arguments are there for all to see and indeed are being proven today by the mass doctor unemployment the bma has consistently asked for improvements whether thats prioritising clinical teaching better induction processes or uniform protocols across trusts but the evidence is clear that the decision making and leadership of nhs england has been in direct conflict with the consultants who used to lead services and the experiences of resident doctors and look where that has brought us but more importantly ill show you where this is about to take us strikes the annual winter crisis morale and retention every winter we hear about the nhs being on the brink we see photos of patients stuck on trolleys in corridors wait times rocketing and discharges delayed for some reason nhse leadership will seize on the nearest explanation that absolves them of responsibility as if winter is an unpredictable event nhs englands chris hopson blamed increased demand on flu and covid in rather than identifying the issues on capacity and providing solutions recently theyve pointed their fingers at strike action implying that the workforces decision to withdraw labour was unreasonable and triggered the crisis as if they were unaware of the year on year results of the national nhs staff survey showing only think their immediate manager works together to come to a shared understanding of problems were satisfied with the recognition they get for good work felt that their work was valued were satisfied with pay felt involved in deciding on changes feel able to make improvements happen were confident that their organisation would address their concerns and feel able to meet the demands put on them but if you compare the timeline these crises occur year after year well before any mention of industrial action even in which saw no major strikes at crucial junctures we had a winter crisis that rivalled previous years the pattern is clear the absolute number of gps has fallen by in the last years the bottlenecks in ae the lack of social care support for stepdown discharges and the chronic underinvestment in infrastructure dont spontaneously emerge because of a few strike days they are structural and longstanding strikes as disruptive as they may appear from the outside are a symptom of deeper dysfunction not the root cause doctors and other healthcare workers dont strike lightly they do so because theyve exhausted other avenues for achieving safe staffing levels fair pay and workable conditions that ultimately serve patients better yet nhses leadership often opts to frame these strikes as reckless or as the singular culprit for all that ails the nhs rather than confront the uncomfortable truth that the systems design is fundamentally flawed the nhs long term workforce plan retention section a fascinating rabbit hole that says an awful lot but does almost nothing it talks about the nhs people promise and links to retention hub looking after our people which links to improving staff retention a guide for line managers and employers which links to this toolkit which in the application slide for examples to use the first link doesnt work the second link is behind a pay wall the third link cycles back round to policyspeake rather than concrete examples essentially it all boils down to listen to your staff and be compassionate but that is never translated into reality because there are no real examples of how to do this for managers and there is a culture set by the leaders of nhs england to not listen to their staff but to protect the reputation and integrity of the brand the nhs nhse leaderships silence on real issues and diversionary tactics the most galling aspect of nhses leadership in my opinion is how selective they can be with their activism when a crisis is unfolding every winter in our hospitals with staff stretched beyond capacity and patients receiving suboptimal care we often hear very little from the top ranks the national medical director and other highprofile figures often provide generic soundbites urging staff to pull together or promising to review the data yet when it comes to the policies they actively promote and the paper trail leads squarely to their feet which are under criticism by doctors en masse sounding the alarm bell they suddenly find their voice a recent example is the coordinated response to a poorly written article in the times which criticised the debate around physician associates pas and how toxic it had become on social media nhs englands leadership jumped on this issuing statements about the need for civility and respect in debate here you can see the national medical director at nhse steven powiss post on x and chief workforce officer navina evans post on x both posts are filled with responses from the public and doctors alike pulling apart the article in the times and providing evidence and context that is conveniently left out lets be clear civility is important no one wants a rancorous abusive conversation dominating professional circles however theres a glaring problem here the underlying issue with the deployment of pas isnt whether doctors are being polite enough in their discussions its that these professionals as they currently stand are comparatively undertrained and are being used as a substitute for fully qualified doctors in some settings this can undermine the quality of care that patients receive and places an unfair burden on the pas themselves who arent equipped with the same level of clinical experience as doctors yet are expected to shoulder significant responsibilities the fact that nhse leadership coordinated a rapid response to defend the introduction of pas but remains conspicuously reticent on the core complaints behind ongoing winter crises or the eroding quality of training speaks volumes about their priorities rather than addressing the legitimate concerns which range from the safety implications of substituting doctors with less trained staff to how this shift might exacerbate existing staffing shortages by diluting the workforce structure they focus on condemning the toxic debate its an exercise in misdirection that doesnt solve any of the real problems the whole experiment of associate professionals is laced with outrageous lies deceptions and espionage which continues to incite the medical profession for example there was a request on th november for an extraordinary general meeting of the royal college of physicians to debate and revalaute the role of pas after it was discovered that pas had been misleading colleagues and patients about their role thousands of illegal prescriptions had been written and mass amounts of ionising radiation requests had been made against the law the egm was supposed to happen within weeks as per the rules of the royal college however it actually occurred on th march conveniently after a parliamentary debate scheduled on th january in attendance professor steven powis national medical director who has no elected role in the rcp was offered the opportunity to answer questions directly by the chair then president dr sarah clarke who had to subsequently resign in disgrace it has since come out that nhs england national leaders coordinated a series of communications and press releases around the delayed rcp events in order to influence the debate abusing their positions of power rather than their equal positions as fellows of the royal college most egregiously though was the presentation of the survey data that was so misrepresented and skewed it lead to the resignation of the registrar for those of you who want to see the egm it was recorded and posted on youtube here if you do choose to watch it ask yourself is this the toxic debate that is being painted physician associates a symptom of a larger workforce problem the introduction of pas into the nhs could have been a boon if done thoughtfully theres undoubtedly a role for physician associates to complement medical teams helping with tasks that free up doctors for more complex work indeed both the bma and the rcp have published scopes of practice that doctors are asking for help with instead were seeing trust after trust recruiting pas to plug the gaps in rotas whilst simultaneously nhse leadership say pas are not a substitute for doctors nhs england leadership has got itself wrapped up in its own lies saying one thing but demonstrably doing another when the leadership lie like this and cant be honest about issues solutions and strategies they will never ever be able to deliver positive outcomes a policy that cant stand up to scrutiny and has to be obscured by lies is not a policy worth having but its not just the nhse leadership its also the previous dhsc advisor to jeremy hunt now ceo of the gmc charlie massey who is in a tangle originally the gmc said it would be for the royal colleges to set scope but then once they had they backtracked over concerns that pas wouldnt be employed the regulator of course not being an employer but an institution that should be upholding standards it is difficult to conclude anything else but that the regulator has been captured by political and institutional interests in pursuing the pa agenda the answer is depressingly simple doctors have been leaving the nhs in droves driven away by burnout inadequate pay progression punishing working conditions and a training structure thats chaotic and lacking in continuity rather than honestly confronting these failings nhses leadership has decided its simpler and cheaper to introduce a new cadre of staff in direct conflict with doctors roles again from the vantage point of a spreadsheet you can see how it might look like a smart solution but from the vantage point of a ward its a shortsighted fix that could jeopardise patient safety and further demoralise doctors who see their roles being devalued where does responsibility lie in many respects the government is ultimately accountable for setting budgets national policy and legislation around healthcare so theres no denying that the secretary of state for health and social care and the treasury have crucial roles to play however nhses leadership doesnt get to shirk its share of the blame they are the ones tasked with executing policy drafting the frameworks for trusts to follow and implementing changes to contracts rotas and workforce planning when doctors complain en masse about unsafe staffing or the decimation of continuity of care the leadership could if they had the will use their influence to advocate for meaningful reforms afterall any effective policy needs buyin from the people on the ground who will be the ones implementing and delivering it unfortunately weve seen time and again how nhses leadership has either stayed silent or offered only cosmetic tweaks consider the following continued rota gaps instead of genuinely negotiating the working patterns in the contract to ensure safer staffing nhse imposed the contract and allowed many trusts to rely on goodwill from exhausted staff and forcibly stab them in the back denying doctors leave for life changing events like weddings or even exams necessary for career progression inadequate teaching support they issue edicts about needing more insitu simulation and interprofessional learning yet do little to ease the service pressures that crowd out teaching time deflection on strikes nhse leaders could have taken the lead in addressing staff concerns at an early stage potentially averting strike action instead they focus on public messaging that frames staff as obstructive multiple times the government refused to come to the negotiation table and yet nhs leaders kept blaming both sides neglecting structural issues from the disjointed rotation system to the glaring lack of standardisation across trusts these are the sorts of largescale organisational problems that national leadership could work to standardise or improve but we continue to languish under disparate policies that cause daily inefficiencies the human cost its important to remember that these leadership decisions have a very real human cost when continuity of care breaks down patients suffer they might have to retell their stories multiple times or experience delays in investigations sometimes an important piece of information about their past medical history or social circumstances might not get passed along properly for doctors the impact is just as profound our training suffers when wardbased clinical teaching is repeatedly cancelled or consultants dont feel invested in training resident doctors because theyll move on shortly our morale takes a hit when were constantly rotating never staying long enough to form lasting relationships with our colleagues or to see the fruits of our work with patients through to the end burnout escalates when the system feels more like an assembly line than a place of compassion and learning ive seen colleagues break down in tears at the end of gruelling shifts convinced theyre failing because no one actually cares about them they feel completely isolated undervalued and the system is designed to literally replace them in a matter of months all while theyre dealing with death and life changing illnesses for the patients they care for ive witnessed promising resident doctors question whether they should continue in the nhs at all or pursue a career abroad where their labour is valued and their training supported each time someone hands in their notice or takes a break from training its a small but significant crack in the foundation of our health service what needs to happen if we genuinely want to address the problems in the nhs we need to look squarely at the decisions coming from inside and at the top of nhs england itself here are a few suggestions that have been floated time and again by frontline staff and professional bodies but have yet to be seriously tackled revisit the contract evaluate whether the purported benefits of spreading doctors more thinly have truly materialised if they havent and theres mounting evidence they havent revert or modify the contract to allow for better continuity of care protect wardbased teaching mandate and enforce policies that guarantee ringfenced time for clinically focused teaching rebuild the team philosophy so that doctors are cared for by other staff this must be recognised as service provision and an investment in more confident and competent staff who will be more proficient at treating patients in the future improve rotational structures whilst rotating can provide some value it shouldnt be so frequent or so poorly planned that it undermines team cohesion and patient care standardise certain protocols across trusts to minimise the chaos of adjusting to new systems every few months finally bring in this fabled nhs passport that captures mandatory learning on which colour fire extinguisher should be used address workforce retention instead of relying on quick fixes like pas to fill gaps double down on retaining qualified doctors by actually teaching them increase the number of training posts and jobs available for career progression competitive remuneration and genuine psychological support from the consultants that they work with that goes beyond a token resilience workshop provided by some hr manager youll never see again clarify the role of physician associates if pas are to be integrated into the nhs they must have a welldefined scope of practice and adequate supervision they should supplement not replace doctors listen to the doctors and use the bma and rcp documents which are what are asking for help with transparency and accountability nhse leaders need to be transparent about the impact of their policies and be willing to share data openly they should invite scrutiny of outcomes rather than hiding behind carefully curated public statements that gloss over systemic failures the public also need to take an interest in the individuals who are actually driving and implementing the policies that are leading to the failure of the nhs rather than solely blaming politicians looking ahead were at a crossroads for the nhs as each year goes by the pressures intensify more staff leave and public satisfaction declines the blame game becomes more fraught and those in senior leadership sometimes appear more invested in protecting their reputations than in rectifying the root causes of these problems reforming the culture requires the right people with the right incentives and disincentives in the right place and we dont have any of those things because the leadership either doesnt have the political courage to be honest and be scrutinised policy expertise to create a more productive framework or operational abilities to deliver the kind of compassionate environment they apparently desire yet the nhs still has an extraordinary dedicated workforce resident doctors consultants nurses allied health professionals support staff and managers on the ground care deeply about their patients and about delivering highquality care theyve proven this time and again braving pandemics winter pressures and political upheavals what they need and what patients deserve is senior leadership that has the courage to admit mistakes reverse damaging policies and engage honestly with those on the front lines to give them the tools they need if we want an nhs thats fit for the next years we need to confront the elephant in the room the senior leadership in nhse must be held to account for decisions that have fundamentally altered the structure of medical work eroded continuity of care and diminished the training environment we cant keep plastering over the cracks and blaming crises on predictable demand pretend that introducing physician associates will magically fill the void left by experienced doctor nor giving the nhs more money when there are clear and obvious reforms that can improve working conditions and productivity true leadership isnt about writing an article defending your chosen policies or issuing press releases in lockstep using contradictory terms like dependent but can also work independently when the national conversation turns inconvenient its about listening to feedback from the trenches taking responsibility for missteps and fighting for the resources and policy changes that will sustain both staff wellbeing and patient outcomes in the long run final thoughts i know a rant on reddit might not change the world overnight but all too often conversations about the nhs boil down to it needs more money or its a black hole for money or privatisation or too many managers i hope this post can spark a more specific conversation about some specific examples of the kinds of things that are going wrong and some solutions that could help as well as highlighting some of the irritating and frustrating circular logic that managers use many of us genuinely want to stay in the nhs and make it work we believe in the principles of a healthcare system free at the point of need but unless those at the top start owning up to their role in the slowmotion collapse were witnessing its hard to be optimistic if youre reading this and youre part of that senior leadership i challenge you to set aside the spin and politics to step out onto the wards and clinics more regularly and to speak with staff at every level hear what theyre saying about rotas continuity of care training and workforce gaps acknowledge how poorly some of these initiatives especially the contract changes have served patients and staff reread the tooke report and the role of the doctor most of us agree with that definition so equip us with the tools actually build strong teams that stay and grow together in the spirit of excellence and reap the dividends of a happy workforce then and only then can we begin to rebuild a system that actually lives up to the ideals upon which the nhs was founded until that day comes well keep calling out the problems and hoping that somewhere in the corridors of nhses headquarters someone is listening and willing to do something different because if we allow the current trajectory to continue we risk losing the heart of the nhs altogether the dedication and expertise of those who work within it and the trust of those who depend upon its

Reddit,"I asked an AI to write a plan for improving economic conditions in the UK. Have a look at this and then review what the Tories haven't been doing:  

""Improving economic conditions for the working class in the UK requires a comprehensive approach that addresses several key issues, including job creation, wage growth, and access to affordable housing and healthcare. Here is a detailed plan that could be implemented to achieve these goals:  

1. Job creation: The government could invest in industries with high potential for job growth, such as renewable energy and technology. Additionally, the creation of new small businesses could be encouraged through tax incentives and easier access to capital.
2. Wage growth: The minimum wage should be increased to a living wage, and policies should be implemented to reduce wage stagnation and inequality. This could be done through measures such as tax credits for low-wage workers and penalties for companies that pay excessively low wages.
3. Affordable housing: The government should increase the supply of affordable housing through programs such as social housing construction and rental subsidies. Additionally, measures should be taken to regulate rent prices and prevent gentrification.
4. Healthcare: The National Health Service (NHS) should be adequately funded to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable, quality healthcare. Additionally, the government could expand access to preventative care and mental health services.
5. Education and training: The government should invest in education and training programs to provide workers with the skills they need to succeed in the modern economy. This could include free or low-cost vocational training and adult education courses.  

These steps could significantly improve the economic conditions for the working class in the UK. However, implementing them will require sustained political will and significant investments of resources.""",2023-02-06 21:06:47,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/10vi76q/i_asked_an_ai_to_write_a_plan_for_improving/,i asked an ai to write a plan for improving economic conditions in the uk have a look at this and then review what the tories havent been doing improving economic conditions for the working class in the uk requires a comprehensive approach that addresses several key issues including job creation wage growth and access to affordable housing and healthcare here is a detailed plan that could be implemented to achieve these goals job creation the government could invest in industries with high potential for job growth such as renewable energy and technology additionally the creation of new small businesses could be encouraged through tax incentives and easier access to capital wage growth the minimum wage should be increased to a living wage and policies should be implemented to reduce wage stagnation and inequality this could be done through measures such as tax credits for lowwage workers and penalties for companies that pay excessively low wages affordable housing the government should increase the supply of affordable housing through programs such as social housing construction and rental subsidies additionally measures should be taken to regulate rent prices and prevent gentrification healthcare the national health service nhs should be adequately funded to ensure that all citizens have access to affordable quality healthcare additionally the government could expand access to preventative care and mental health services education and training the government should invest in education and training programs to provide workers with the skills they need to succeed in the modern economy this could include free or lowcost vocational training and adult education courses these steps could significantly improve the economic conditions for the working class in the uk however implementing them will require sustained political will and significant investments of resources,4,4_the_of_to_and,neutral,0.7139395475387573,neutral,0.5744794607162476

Reddit,"DAE want to discuss and criticise the Online Safety Act?. So I need to talk about this Act. It has been 2 days since it has passed and it's already caused a lot of upheaval amongst UK citizens. This situation is deeply troubling — I’ve even had to use a VPN just to bypass the extremely stringent geo restrictions. 

For those that don't know, the Online Safety Act 2025 - which applies to the entirety of the UK - is as follows:

*""As of 25 July 2025, platforms have a legal duty to protect children online. Platforms are now required to use highly effective age assurance to prevent children from accessing pornography, or content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorder content.*

*Platforms must also prevent children from accessing other harmful and age-inappropriate content such as bullying, hateful content and content which encourages dangerous stunts or ingesting dangerous substances. Platforms must also provide parents and children with clear and accessible ways to report problems online when they do arise.""*

*Here's my thoughts on why the Act looks good on paper, but is poorly executed in practice and my criticisms that I have.*





\~ Why the Act is good (on paper) \~

I think that the intention of the OSA is beneficial and beyond important. It protects kids from having access to pornographic content, things that they shouldn't really see, and that they're deconstructing the blatantly exploitative porn industry (through no longer contributing to the exploitation, brutalisation, and abuse of women) and preventing kids from becoming addicted to and picking things up (like misogyny or treating women like commodities / objects), which is **CRUCIAL AND ESSENTIAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE.**



\~ Creative Freedom, Survivors, and Emotional Lifelines Under Threat \~

However, from my perspective, now it's extremely difficult for me to get access to mental health subreddits so I can vent and get advice, because now, anything deemed ""mature"" or ""NSFW"" is restricted and ID-gated (including this website), and doing creative writing through these chatbots (which I have been doing for the past few months or so, but not for porn or anything like that - I use it for comfort, venting, meeting my emotional needs rather than sexual, exploring certain dynamics - giant x tiny, roleplaying based on given scenarios, worldbuilding for my OCs) and it's both infuriating and tragic, because writers and artists - websites with drawing references are also being censored - are effectively being legislated away, lumped up, and torn away who need those tools for emotional safety, comfort, creative expression, etc because they are caught in the crossfire - myself included.

From what I've seen on TikTok, some subreddits like the r/sexualassault subreddit - advice and a meaningful, tolerant, safe, trauma-informed space for SURVIVORS of sexual assault, are being completely restricted by arbitrary ID checks that get outsourced to third party verification firms in countries like the USA, which is just entirely backwards and poses a huge risk of data breaches, whilst also potentially goes against the DPA 2018 (\*\*Data Protection Act 2018\*\*) and RIPA 2000 (\*\*Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\*\*).

Not only that, it could potentially go against **Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights** — freedom of expression, which this legislation may violate through overbroad content censorship.

Literally EVERYTHING with the littlest of NSFW content is being censored, including **mental health support groups**, **LGBTQIA+ content**, **survivor and trauma stories**, war crimes in **Gaza / Palestine** and the newly developing **Thailand-Cambodia conflict (which as of writing this has ended),** meaning the whole thing is poorly executed - extremely.

It SHUTS down victims and discourages already marginalised groups of people - whether that be neurodivergent folks, LGBTQIA+ / Queer people, people in MH crisis and those with complex trauma, victims of sexual assault / child sexual abuse / rape / child-on-child sexual assault - as well as a plethora of other groups from having access to lifelines and processing their trauma and regulating emotions through exploring dark themes - myself included.



\~ The Economic Monopoly and Late-Capitalist Consumerism: Crushing Small Platforms \~

It really is terrifying if you think about it as well. The UK proposes to become a global technological hub whilst simultaneously building a digital iron curtain around itself.

This whole thing also effectively **monopolises high-tech / big tech companies that can actually AFFORD the legal infrastructure in the first place**, whilst small companies (like JanitorAI and others), get crushed underfoot under legal pressure - I'm sure your aware that they can be fined £18mn in breaches of non-compliance, which supports late-capitalist consumerism and it leans heavily towards classist logic in the form of ""eat the rich, fuck the poor"", essentially digital gentrification.



\~ Political perspectives : Echoes of Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Communism / Fascism, Laissez-Faire Leadership Styles, and Dystopian Narratives / Dichotomies \~

The fact that the petition on parliament has over **200,000 SIGNATURES** and the UK government - Labour (who many see as Conservatives but in red) - **STILL HAVEN'T RESPONDED** speaks volumes about their blatantly **laissez-faire and hedonistic rulership style.** They don't care about the citizens or child safety.

This may sound extreme, but the pattern is deeply unsettling: mass censorship, silencing dissent, and marginalised groups being punished for existing online. These are not just features of dystopian fiction—they’re hallmarks of early authoritarian and totalitarian systems throughout history - and people are comparing it to the likes of Nazi Germany, The USSR / Soviet Union, China, and North Korea.

It really is a slippery slope, and it eerily echoes narratives in dystopian fiction - **1984, The Hunger Games with Panem, and The Handmaid's Tale. This whole situation is honestly just giving just that, and the silence from leadership speaks volumes—and it's a silence that endangers lives.**

**Not only that, it also seems to set up this whole rhetoric or dichotomy / binary opposition where you're either a child that needs to be protected or a perverse child predator - and that is indescribably absurd because it's essentially the same as ""guilty until proven innocent"" or ""suspicious until proven otherwise"", which just completely goes against the legal system we have in the UK.**

**And I also hate that people are generalising those who use VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions as porn addicts - which is true but at the same time it is very dehumanising. It isn't just about porn.**



**\~** Why It Actually Endangers Children More \~

Whilst on the topic of child predators, the OSA does very ironically the **EXACT OPPOSITE** of protecting children from accessing porn and NSFW content. This whole act, whilst the intention is great, does not distract from the fact that it increases the chances of child predators getting into spaces where there are children (because the ID verification firms aforementioned use AI and can be easily bypassed - which are deeply flawed, unreliable, and cost-prohibitive — failing the very purpose they claim to serve), people accessing dodgy websites with criminal and beyond disgusting / criminal / illegal activity, and let's not forget how it increases the incidence of **revenge porn and CSAM** as it pushes users into hidden, unregulated corners of the internet by making it harder to spot and report predators who exploit these gaps, and by increasing stigma and silence, which makes victims less likely to seek help or come forward.

Hell, even people are using **Tor browser** to bypass the geo-restrictions, which is used to go the **DARK WEB** keep in mind.

\~ Concerns for the future \~

This Online Safety Act that has now been enforced honestly just seems like a huge legal, ethical, moral, geo-political disaster waiting to happen coded up under the thin veneer of language relating to child safety.

I am deeply ashamed and appalled by the state that the government is in.

And not only that, other countries like Australia and the EU are trying to adopt the same type of legislations in the next upcoming months. And it needs to be called out. We deserve better than this. We simply can't go silently.",2025-07-28 23:21:24,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1mbvoz4/dae_want_to_discuss_and_criticise_the_online/,dae want to discuss and criticise the online safety act so i need to

https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2019-01/no-deal-brexit-reportage-portsmouth-wetherspoon-pub-tim-martin/komplettansicht


Translation: 

**Everything for Brexit**

Portsmouth is a poor port city on the English Channel, but that hasn't changed since the time of Charles Dickens. In front of the city's largest pub, two hours from London, stands a statue of the poet of the poor. The man who approaches the pub at noon does not notice it, however, he pushes himself through the door with wide shoulders.

This pub is his own pub: Tim Martin is the founder and boss of the Wetherspoon pubs that exist all over Britain. He bought his first pub 40 years ago and now owns a chain of more than 800 pubs. You can usually find them in areas where people can't afford good restaurants. Here in Portsmouth the pub is named after another famous son of the city, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the great engineer of the Industrial Revolution, the docks and the ocean liner. 

The scream of the seagulls dies, Martin meets the pleasant pub warmth. Martin didn't want any smoky dive. His pubs should be for the whole family: solid, cheap, good - and with the atmosphere of a large living room.

Right at the entrance, an old marine chef sits on a bar stool, under his shirt sleeve the tattoo of a bare-breasted beauty peeps out. Martin nods to him friendly, he is a giant and overlooks the hustle and bustle in the pub immediately. He pushes to the bar, greets the young men and women at the bar who draw beer. Then his gaze glides over the tables, where families with children eat burgers with chips for 4.99 pounds for lunch, men are lost in conversation with Fosters, young mothers chat in a corner of a book, all flickering in the corners of the gaming machines, pictures of the seafaring cruisers on the walls.

**For a Brexit without a deal**

On the tables there are little signs with Brexit slogans, on the windows there are political posters. Because Martin is not only a successful pub owner, he is a radical Brexit supporter. Like hardly any other entrepreneur, he fights for his exit from the EU - without a deal. Many pub-goers know him from talk shows and Brexit campaigns with Nigel Farage, the former head of the right-wing outer party Ukip. Martin uses his pubs to bring his politics to the people.


""That's a great man,"" enthuses a woman who drinks coffee with milk. ""He's a businessman and he fights so hard for our Brexit."" Many in the pub hope that the British Parliament will vote to leave the EU on Tuesday. So that they too can finally feel better; not just the rich, not just the political elite. But perhaps it won't work, the Sunday newspapers are full of reports that the supporters of Europe will sabotage the Brexit in parliament.

**Unexpected protest**

Pub visitors are already crowding in, selfies are being made, a camera crew appears, someone hands the microphone to the Wetherspoon Pub founder. ""Thank you for all being there,"" Martin lifts up, his white head of hair almost under the ceiling, he has climbed onto a pedestal, a railing in front of him, it almost looks like in the courtroom. ""Come here, everybody, very close!"" People are crowded, men with beer in their hands, rough, red tanned faces. A woman listens devoutly and Martin starts: ""We voted for the Brexit because we want to get out. And not because we want to sign a deal with Juncker. Without the deal, we'd be better off!""

And he immediately comes to the subject that annoys many: the billions that Britain has to pay the EU when it withdraws from the EU for the payment obligations it has entered into in the past. Many Britons don't see this and Martin strikes the right note: ""We could save these 39 billion pounds that we are supposed to pay to the EU. That's 600 pounds for every Briton."" Martin has taken off his jacket. ""Go around here and ask everyone to write a cheque for 600 pounds!"" Now people are clapping.

""That's not true,"" someone shouts, unexpectedly there's a protest. Martin and the pub visitors assumed that the Brexit followers were among themselves and that the truth would finally be told. But Martin has the microphone and continues: ""Without a deal we could abolish our customs duties, we could buy everything much cheaper in the world, children's clothes, children's shoes, our Australian wine here ...  Everything would be cheaper"". That's Martin's credo, no other pub entrepreneur in Great Britain works with such tight margins, pays so much attention to low purchase prices.   

A young man in a black jacket pushes himself forward: ""Don't lie, Tim. Tell the truth,"" he shouts. ""Shut up,"" a beer-drinker snaps, ""we want to hear Tim - not you smart-ars."" Several EU supporters have come to the pub to drive Martin to the parade and put forward arguments that the Brexit supporters don't really want to hear.

**The fight for truth and feelings**

Martin demands quiet. ""Then tell the truth,"" the man in the black jacket shouts again, waving a Brexit poster that Martin has had distributed in his pubs. The man introduces himself as Jason Hunter, he is a vehement opponent of Brexit and knows something about international free trade agreements. He has been joined by other representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party. ""We are for Europe! We are retainers,"" a blonde woman from the group explains eagerly.

Hunter really gets started now, even Martin listens for a moment. ""We've worked this out with experts in Geneva,"" he says, trying to explain the effect of foreign trade tariffs after the World Trade Organisation. Britain exports 470 million pounds of British products every day to the EU and the 60 countries with which the EU has free trade agreements. ""If you don't want a free trade agreement, then our exports will be more expensive in all these countries, then the higher tariffs of the World Trade Organization will apply,"" he argues. He gets danced on, realises that people are not following him. Too complicated. He tries a simpler example: ""Beer from the EU would be much more expensive here. Do you really think people will come to your pub if your beer here costs five pounds a pint more? ""Now Hunter gets applause - but only from the European supporters. 

""We don't want to hear that,"" a Brexit fan snaps. Martin swings: ""That's just their opinion. ""Hunter explodes: ""No - it's the facts"". Word fragments fly through the air, sweat beads are standing on Martin's face, and there is a jostling in front of his eyes. The mothers look over, even the sailor turns around. Someone scolds: ""You stupid know-it-alls. Get out of here."" One almost has the feeling that the situation could become palpable.

**Everything is based on feelings**

A woman with a beer glass in her hand pushes herself forward to Hunter, her voice trembling with rage: ""I'm for the Brexit,"" she pushes out. ""I am two hundred percent for the Brexit. And I will tell them one thing: We are not stupid! The beer in their glass sloshes in the jostle. ""No matter how mean and disgusting you are, we'll never, never, never let you change our minds,"" she rules Hunter. One of the liberals tries to appease the woman, but she screams in rage: ""Shut up and let me finish"". She trembles: ""I am fed up with the EU! I'm through with the subject! She turns around and fights her way through the crowd towards the exit. 

""That's exactly the problem,"" says Paul Gray, who stands next to Hunter. He is a Liberal Party candidate in a suburb of Portsmouth. He shakes his head. ""It's all based on feelings, it's all hearsay - it's so dangerous."" Gray seems resigned. For the pub appearance he put on a grey jacket, the posters of his party showed him in a suit. ""It's a class problem,"" he says. The EU supporters in the country are better educated and argue more objectively. As soon as they wanted to refute the simple polemics, the platitudes of the Brexit hardliners with facts, people switched off and got angry. The complexity of tariffs, the effect of trade agreements, the labyrinth of EU rules are difficult to understand. And when EU supporters eloquently explain it, it seems arrogant and arrogant. ""I am so angry at what the Brexit people are doing to our country,"" says Gray. 

**The EU as a dangerous experiment**

Martin has put the microphone away, he now prefers to explain his world in a direct conversation. The bystanders believe in him. And he believes in himself. ""The EU has only seven percent of the world's population. We can buy everything we import from the EU just as well and cheaper from the remaining 93 percent of the world,"" he claims. He has already replaced the popular Jägermeister in his pubs with the cheaper British liqueur Strika. He doesn't say that Becks and Krombacher from Germany and Absolut-Wodka from Sweden are on the menu.

A pub visitor dares to ask a question: ""Even if we get our No Deal - the politicians don't want that. They're cheating us."" The pub owner doesn't contradict and scolds the elites in Theresa May's cabinet - without mentioning that he himself studied law, became a lawyer and now heads a corporation. And of course to the EU. ""You can't deselect anyone there. That's completely undemocratic. The EU is a dangerous experiment.

The bystanders thank Martin. An older couple quickly makes a selfie with him, a woman wants an autograph. In the end it was a success despite the disturbance, Martin is visibly satisfied. The people feel understood, even by the pub boss. And if the hard Brexit comes the way he wants it, people won't forget it. He fought for them. And for himself.

Reddit,"Has anyone else found university thoroughly disappointing and almost a step-backwards in life?. I'd like to preface this message by saying I am a first year student at a top 20 UK university, currently studying a course involving computing and business. These are my experiences but I know these incidents are not isolated to my university or course. 

I would like to give you a somewhat brief summary of the nitty gritty of what has happened to me this year at university, and explain why I've been left with a sour taste in my mouth. 

Maybe it can help a few of you influence your decisions and future choices, or just give you an excuse to rant with me.

**Accomodation**


* Today, somebody just **pissed up the wall** outside my block after exclaiming, 'ha, he's doing work' whilst walking past my window.
* Near enough every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday night I get **woken up** by drunk people **screaming** outside my window at **2,3,4 o'clock in the morning**. I've had to **buy earplugs**.
* **Food goes missing** out my cupboard regularly. My squash drank itself. I had one drink out of it and then it just mysteriously gradually evaporated. Should've filled it with laxatives.
* Somebody **cracked the fridge** slightly at the bottom. **Cosmetic damage only**. It was still fully functional. A **new fridge** was bought. We were **each charged £21** for the replacement. I knew nothing of the damage until an email about the charge came through.
* The **new fridge didn't even have a freezer** compartment. I complained. **One and a half months later** we got a fridge-freezer. I looked up the model number. Found it for sale by John Lewis. Worked out we were **over charged by £50** on this price.
* Somebody else managed to smoke out the whole block - all 3 floors - by **leaving garlic bread in the microwave for 15 mins** on a microwave setting instead of oven setting.
* I'm catered 5 days a week. **I don't have an oven** for the weekend. 
* Catered menu consists of about **20 dishes** for the whole year.
* Someone **broke down their door with a hockey stick** as they were drunk and couldn't get in to it.
* **Common room was smashed to pieces one night,** broken glass everywhere, walls damaged, pool table ruined.
* Common room damage was done by people living in the same halls.
* Had to pay out another **£20 in damages for things I had no knowledge of** as someone kicked the toilet door, and damaged surface in the kitchen.

There are many more incidents that I've had the pleasure of witnessing, but that's enough to get started on. Now for the lectures, teaching and pricing... Jesus, this really makes me annoyed.

**Teaching**

* £9000 split between 2 semesters, with 12 weeks in each, and around 13 lectures each week lasting 50 minutes each equates to **£34.62 per hour of teaching.** 
* One module this year consisted of **95% GCSE maths**. I'm talking y=mx+c kind of stuff. It's a joke. Having achieved a - by no means special - B grade in A-level Maths I found this unbelievably trivial. So trivial in fact that **I gave the first couple of worksheets to my niece in Year 9 who could do them without difficulty**. 
* I must have **answered at least 95/100 questions correctly** in 'tutorials' for this subject and **answered many in-class questions**, as well as did **way over my fair share of group work**... **I got 63/100 for the tutorials**. I enquired as to why. I got a meeting with the head of the module. He said according to my tutor I hadn't answered all the questions. I had. He asked if I could prove it, assuming I hadn't kept all the work. I had kept all my work. I showed him. He remarked it. **Bumped it up to 70/100**. Said nothing more could be done as **other marks were due to 'in class contributions'** which couldn't be remarked. 
* **Peers with other tutors** who had come to me for help numerous times got **80-90/100** on this coursework.
* I got 92% on the actual proper test as if that's any consolation.
* Other subjects include **programming**, taught by a **lecturer** who is **so inanimate and robotic it is impossible to follow him**. I'm sorry, I've had bad teachers in the past, but this is beyond a joke. After researching the material after the useless lectures **I could turn around and teach them better than him.** In fact, **as a group we often had to go and learn everything off YouTube ourselves** and teach ourselves and each other. 
* **Awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that, 'you should be doing independent learning'**, yet they provide no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement. These books are quite frankly, **shit**.
* **Lecturers often plug their own books** which **cost £40+** and are no use anyway.
* **The programming coursework was nigh on impossible given the teaching we had been given.** The only way our class scraped through was via the help of a student who had done this stuff in his spare time for the past 3 years and could give advice as to what to do. **Teachers weren't allowed to assist** in this coursework. **No unmarked related practice work was given previous to this coursework.** We were literally thrown in at the deep end with no help available.
* We had a Chinese lecturer who's **English was so bad that 80% of the class left halfway** **through** due to a lack of understanding of what she was saying. 
* Had a **computing lecturer who's demos failed near enough every week** and had to be **corrected by the class**. In one class **I even solved a problem** after the teacher was scratching his head for 30 seconds looking at the code. **I am utterly shit at programming** and don't even know what I'm doing and still managed to do this.

These are just isolated incidents, and there are many more, but this is getting long-winded by now so I'll leave it at that. 

Besides, I've got to go and revise for my tests now and make sure I get my £27,000 certificate that says, 'yep, he can do stuff that he could do at the end of sixth form anyway', at the end of this joke that is a university education.

Any incidents or comments regarding your university experiences would be much appreciated, thanks.

**TL;DR My university is overpriced, full of drunk idiots who are costing me money and keeping me up at night, and it isn't teaching me anything I couldn't learn for free anyway at a much faster rate online from YouTube.**

 EDIT: This is really blowing up. Thanks for all the comments. As a thank you, here's a couple of pics of the fridge that needed replacing. [WARNING: Very badly damaged fridge pics inside NSFW.](http://imgur.com/a/nmCdS)

EDIT2: Someone just smashed a bottle of beer off a lampost outside my window putting glass on the grass as some bank holiday party thing is going on on the green behind my block. Fuck me, this is a joke. 

EDIT3: There are some absolutely amazing responses in this thread and I've learnt a fair bit today about what I need to do to make it all worthwhile. Now I've got my angry rant out the way, here's an amalgamation of what others have taught me today: 

**Top Tips**

* Regarding accommodation, it's a lottery. Some halls are quiet, some are rowdy. It's down to chance what hand you get dealt, just make the most of it and try and be as care-free as possible. There is pretty much sod all you can do about it for the first year... Just find some like-minded mates and make it to your second year intact!

* The library is infinitely better to revise in than your room. I personally need to get off my lazy arse, make the walk to it and get my work done. 3 hours in the library smashing out work is better than 12 hours half working, half redditing and half getting distracted by flat-mates and neighbours. 

* Lecturers may appear half-arsed and crappy at face value, but that's because they have a lot more on their plate than what meets the eye. I had no idea they were so involved in research and PHD studies previous to this thread, so before you get angry at their piss poor performance send them some emails and ask for help... If they still aren't any good, then you can be angry.

* Do something worthwhile in your spare time that you can slap on a CV at the end of it all and be proud of. The amount of time off is ridiculous so learn a hobby, partake in sports, internships, clubs, societies, instruments, languages, whatever, just go for it. Be purposeful!
* If you do something related to the field of work you want to work in then that's even better!
* If you get totally fed up of work, revision and halls then just make a revision thread bitching about university and post it on Reddit. It'll sort you out and put you right back on track. ;)

Cheers!",2014-05-05 16:18:27,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24s9g9/has_anyone_else_found_university_thoroughly/,has anyone else found university thoroughly disappointing and almost a stepbackwards in life id like to preface this message by saying i am a first year student at a top uk university currently studying a course involving computing and business these are my experiences but i know these incidents are not isolated to my university or course i would like to give you a somewhat brief summary of the nitty gritty of what has happened to me this year at university and explain why ive been left with a sour taste in my mouth maybe it can help a few of you influence your decisions and future choices or just give you an excuse to rant with me accomodation today somebody just pissed up the wall outside my block after exclaiming ha hes doing work whilst walking past my window near enough every tuesday wednesday and friday night i get woken up by drunk people screaming outside my window at oclock in the morning ive had to buy earplugs food goes missing out my cupboard regularly my squash drank itself i had one drink out of it and then it just mysteriously gradually evaporated shouldve filled it with laxatives somebody cracked the fridge slightly at the bottom cosmetic damage only it was still fully functional a new fridge was bought we were each charged for the replacement i knew nothing of the damage until an email about the charge came through the new fridge didnt even have a freezer compartment i complained one and a half months later we got a fridgefreezer i looked up the model number found it for sale by john lewis worked out we were over charged by on this price somebody else managed to smoke out the whole block all floors by leaving garlic bread in the microwave for mins on a microwave setting instead of oven setting im catered days a week i dont have an oven for the weekend catered menu consists of about dishes for the whole year someone broke down their door with a hockey stick as they were drunk and couldnt get in to it common room was smashed to pieces one night broken glass everywhere walls damaged pool table ruined common room damage was done by people living in the same halls had to pay out another in damages for things i had no knowledge of as someone kicked the toilet door and damaged surface in the kitchen there are many more incidents that ive had the pleasure of witnessing but thats enough to get started on now for the lectures teaching and pricing jesus this really makes me annoyed teaching split between semesters with weeks in each and around lectures each week lasting minutes each equates to per hour of teaching one module this year consisted of gcse maths im talking ymxc kind of stuff its a joke having achieved a by no means special b grade in alevel maths i found this unbelievably trivial so trivial in fact that i gave the first couple of worksheets to my niece in year who could do them without difficulty i must have answered at least questions correctly in tutorials for this subject and answered many inclass questions as well as did way over my fair share of group work i got for the tutorials i enquired as to why i got a meeting with the head of the module he said according to my tutor i hadnt answered all the questions i had he asked if i could prove it assuming i hadnt kept all the work i had kept all my work i showed him he remarked it bumped it up to said nothing more could be done as other marks were due to in class contributions which couldnt be remarked peers with other tutors who had come to me for help numerous times got on this coursework i got on the actual proper test as if thats any consolation other subjects include programming taught by a lecturer who is so inanimate and robotic it is impossible to follow him im sorry ive had bad teachers in the past but this is beyond a joke after researching the material after the useless lectures i could turn around and teach them better than him in fact as a group we often had to go and learn everything off youtube ourselves and teach ourselves and each other awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that you should be doing independent learning yet they provide no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement these books are quite frankly shit lecturers often plug their own books which cost and are no use anyway the programming coursework was nigh on impossible given the teaching we had been given the only way our class scraped through was via the help of a student who had done this stuff in his spare time for the past years and could give advice as to what to do teachers werent allowed to assist in this coursework no unmarked related practice work was given previous to this coursework we were literally thrown in at the deep end with no help available we had a chinese lecturer whos english was so bad that of the class left halfway through due to a lack of understanding of what she was saying had a computing lecturer whos demos failed near enough every week and had to be corrected by the class in one class i even solved a problem after the teacher was scratching his head for seconds looking at the code i am utterly shit at programming and dont even know what im doing and still managed to do this these are just isolated

Reddit,"It was never about anti-semitism—some thoughts on Corbyn and this General Election. As I intend to vote for the British Labour Party on 12 December, I am committed to understanding one of the most serious charges laid before it and its current captain: antisemitism.

Before I do, a quick note that:

* I am not and never have been a member of the Labour Party, 
* I am not a “fan” of Jeremy Corbyn, and regularly discuss his faults with other progressives and some conservative friends of mine, 
* I typically vote Green whenever I can, 
* I am a British-Canadian dual national.

Let’s get into things, shall we?

### “Antisemitism is rife within the Labour Party”

There is undoubtedly a degree of antisemitism within Labour, and this **must** be treated seriously, something the Labour Party under Corbyn has arguably failed to do adequately (see [this article](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/bad-news-for-labour-an-essential-handbook); search for “Philo and Berry are highly critical of the Labour leadership for the inadequacy of its reaction to this relentless campaign”). 

Do keep in mind, however, that the “inadequacy of [Labour’s] reaction” has little to do with the legitimacy (or lack thereof) of the allegations, but rather with Labour’s inability to **[“counter the propaganda”](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/bad-news-for-labour-an-essential-handbook/)**. The number of antisemitism cases amongst Labour’s membership was revealed in February 2019 to be **0.08% of Labour members** (for period of April 2018 – January 2019; [see Rebuttal 7, point 6](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/statement/rebuttals)).

This is **much less than the average of 3.6% for the general population** discovered by the [Institute for Jewish Policy Research in 2017](https://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf), which conforms to similar research by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism from 2017 which shows that [“Labour Party supporters are less likely to be antisemitic than other voters”](https://antisemitism.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Antisemitism-Barometer-2017.pdf).

Still, the CAA’s [newer 2019 study](https://antisemitism.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Antisemitism-Barometer-2019.pdf) suggests that “The leader of the once fiercely anti-racist Labour Party is now the candidate of choice for anti-Jewish racists”, as well as that

>	*“Two in five British Jews [are considering] leaving the UK over antisemitism in the past two years alone, 85% of them because of antisemitism in politics, with two thirds expressly mentioning the Labour Party* **or its leader** *(my emphasis) as their reason”*

These are worrying statistics and must be treated as such. However, as Channel 4’s FactCheck has pointed out, **there is also danger of a “chicken-and-egg” scenario here**, given that:

1) [“63 per cent of British Jews voted for the Conservatives in 2017, while just 26 per cent said they voted Labour”](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-antisemitism-political-parties),

2) [The level of negative press coverage of the Labour Party is is another category](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-3#section-5) compared to other leading parties in this election, 

2.1) “The [Media Reform Coalition] has identified a [“disinformation paradigm”](https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/27893/1/Labour-antisemitism-and-the-news-FINAL-PROOFED.pdf) when it comes to mainstream reporting of allegations of antisemitism within the Labour Party”, with one professor calling it a [“strategic mobilisation of the issue of antisemitism against Corbyn”](https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/s70_02antisemitism-discussion.pdf), 

2.2) [“Just three companies dominate 83% of the national newspaper market (up from 71% in 2015)”](https://www.mediareform.org.uk/media-ownership/who-owns-the-uk-media).

There is also the question of the bolded phrase above — **“or its leader”** — which relates to the title and fundamental point of my writing this.

Since his election to the post of party leader in September 2015, Corbyn has represented a significant shift in the Labour Party status quo. The [self-professed](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/jeremy-corbyn-labour-britain/401492/) democratic socialist would, in some ways, return the Labour Party to its leftist roots — reversing its trend toward the centre in the mid-1990s through [bold policies](https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/) like nationalising water, energy, rail, and broadband internet; scrapping university tuition fees; raising the minimum wage; and implementing a comprehensive National Care Service for older citizens and those with disabilities.

Without indulging in conspiracy, and based on the above points, **I believe it is fair to assume that the powers-that-be are terrified of a Corbyn-led Labour Government**, as they stand to lose the most from Labour’s policies.

Moreover, these powers have correctly identified his biggest weakness: **naivety**.

>	*“Philo and Berry are highly critical of the Labour leadership for the inadequacy of its reaction to this relentless campaign. The reasons for its inability to counter the attacks include: a) internal disunity, so that it became difficult to formulate a coherent response, especially as Labour was lacking in “a strong public relations infrastructure”; b) lack of control by the new leadership over the entrenched Labour party machinery, some of which was working against Corbyn;* ***c) Corbyn’s deep personal sense of hurt and bewilderment at being called a racist that has hindered him from being able to deal with the onslaught.”*** ([source](https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/bad-news-for-labour-an-essential-handbook/))

I have long believed that a form of “creative naivety” is the fundamental trait of the progressive archetype. It is, as author Charles Eisenstein would put it, the relentless and imaginative pursuit of [“the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible”](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/) — the seeing of new worlds, and the negotiation with old worlds for the metabolism of novelty within them. This is an internal battle as much as it is an external one. It is the fight to keep love in our hearts when we are heartbroken. It is the paradox of receiving grace, while defending with willpower the beauty it provides.

While this hallmark trait of progressive thought and action clearly has its strengths, the obvious risk is that by keeping our hearts open, we may become paralysed by “hurt and bewilderment”. The connotative history of the word “naivety” reveals the weakness therein: **without an ability to defend naivety from cynical forces, the cynic** — with its exceptionally practical message of “let’s keep things the way they were” — **will win the day**. The weakness of the progressive is part of his strength: **a lack of wisdom or experience of how to combat the cynicism of his opponents and the fears of those who follow them**.

Judging by the Labour platform of policies and his political career, Jeremy Corbyn is pushing to realise a more beautiful world. He is also, as most good people tend to be, [rather simple](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/jeremy-corbyn-labour-britain/401492/):

>	*""Known for his beige outfits and ascetic tendencies, he likes to cycle and has no car. He loves making jam with fruit grown on his allotment, belongs to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cheese and is a train obsessive.""*

In Tolkien’s epic *The Lord of the Rings*, there is a moment where Faramir — son of Gondor and brother to Boromir — captures the hobbits Frodo and Sam. Faramir asks Frodo if Sam is his bodyguard, and Sam replies indignantly, **“[his gardener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jvo0xERjB0)”**.

Soon after, following [one of the greatest speeches ever delivered on film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1J3Aba9GxA), Faramir is convinced to release the hobbits, thereby resisting the power of the ring which nearly consumed his brother. Speaking again to Sam, he muses:

>	*“The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee, where gardeners are held in high honour.”*

Historian Sir George Clark claimed of The Lord of the Rings that [“the unexpected hero…called a fool until called to great actions by great needs, proves to be Samwise Gamgee”](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ES0Hs75IVg0C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=%22called%20a%20fool%20until%20called%20to%20great%20actions%20by%20great%20needs%2C%20proves%20to%20be%20Samwise%20Gamgee%E2%80%9D%22&source=bl&ots=NMlsNQvqW0&sig=ACfU3U3mJT-9A17jhqjk0tc97_uLpeFZaQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjz8qfy0pXmAhUFqXEKHZYYD0QQ6AEwC3oECAsQAQ&fbclid=IwAR2bAaLttVSbwjUXLewRvzGqsQnUFuNfWMnYSphi3iPlvquj-SCPzCPCneI#v=onepage&q=%22called%20a%20fool%20until%20called%20to%20great%20actions%20by%20great%20needs%2C%20proves%20to%20be%20Samwise%20Gamgee%E2%80%9D%22&f=false).

**To me, it would not be a far cry to say that Jeremy Corbyn is the Samwise Gamgee of today’s Britain**. If he is to be admonished for his failures, it should be for his inability to appropriately retaliate against dark forces with the decisiveness of someone who understands cynicism, and knows how to combat it. He is naive— therein lies both his strength and weakness.

But this isn’t just his fight. It’s the fight of everyone who would see a better world, and work to safeguard its arrival.

He may not be as charismatic as Bernie Sanders. He may not be as virtuous as Samwise Gamgee. But for this election at least, I believe in the honour of the gardener from Islington.",2019-12-02 16:22:38,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/e51c5d/it_was_never_about_antisemitismsome_thoughts_on/,it was

Reddit,"Simplifying the controversial Online Safety Bill. # Context

The [Online Safety Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137) is making its way through the house of commons and is in the latter stages of being implemented. 

> A Bill to make provision for and in connection with the regulation by OFCOM of certain internet services; for and in connection with communications offences; and for connected purposes 

In this thread I will attempt to provide an unbiased and layman friendly argument as to why this bill could be a concern and why it's controversial. 

# In simple terms what is the bill about? 

* It's purpose is to hold tech companies responisble for 'online harm' 

* It said tech companies need to regulate content around explicit illegal images, harmful words, cyberbulling and abuse.

* It also was expanded to include censoring what news is allowed e.g. ""anti vax information"" or conspiracies. Age checks on adult sites. Cancel culture. Content about immagration and others 

* Indirectly proposes an end to ""encrpyted"" communication like Whatsapp/Signal among others

New Precedents being introduced: 

***Platforms check content, instead of algorithms***

Whereas in the past tech companies like Whatsapp, Facebook and YouTube would ""police"" their use using algorithms that picked up on things. Now the move is much more explicit about policing the ""content"" so, that means looking at the images, text, audio, video of everthing and scanning it for ""harmful content"". 

***Users no longer have privacy*** 

all your content is by law mandated to be scanned and visible to be policed. Tech companies aren't allowed to provide you with a secure means to communicate or participate in sharing information online anymore. Whatsapp groups, private emails, nsfw images, reddit comments etc

***The Government decide what is considered harm, what is ""real/fake"" news, what is inappropriate, what is explicit, what is bullying etc*** 

Whereas in the past the platforms could add mechanism to police these things and in some areas people enjoyed free speach. Now the govrnment will be deciding what the interpretation of their meaning is and what's considered allowed or not. 

# History and contex of the bill 

Bill started from discussions between academics Lorna Wood and William Perrin. Initially as a way to make tech platforms like Facebook and Tiktok responsible for hosting harmful content. 

The bill was then changed by the Tory administration adding their own stuff (such as immigration) and significantly increasing it's complexity. They also added some exceptions for ""democratic importance"" and news publishers which would give the government the ability to make the bill not applicable to themselves when they deem themselves exempt, as well as any news they want as well.


To some extent the bill has become a ""catch all"" for all kinds of things and is a bit of a mess. 

# Why is it a concern to me though? 

There's a great deal to unpack in this bill and there's extremely concerning precedents being set. There's also a lot of different groups in society that this will affect from boomers, to rich people, to zoomers, nerds, private-people, children and parents, LGBTQ*, left/right-wingers as well as those who indulge in apathy.

Each group will have their own bias and I don't want to focus on our differences today. I want to focus on the things that bring us together so let's look at why this bill is problematic for *humans* and is as simple as that. 

## The system of humans 🤖

In the UK in the morning after the first fuzzy 5-30 seconds of waking up we log in to ""a human in UK Society"" with our mind. 

In that society as a user we get some cool features like:

* A currency and market to purchase products and services

* Security and protection for ourselves and our property 

* Free education and healthcare 

In short, when we wake up and *log in* we get to participate in a bunch of governance services. These things are what prop us up as a ""civilized developed country"". These things are actually quite good when we compare them to the world and is one of the many reasons the UK is a popular place to emmigration destination. 

On the surface we have a great country right? 

Although when we look deeper we see something different. Each pillar or institution in our society is riddled with issues, lots of them. 

* Finance and markets - In our implementation of capitalism there's some serious issues. Corporations largely exploit the UK by taking money from people in the form of subscription models, purchases for smart phones or bottles of water or other means. Then these corporations use various loopholes to avoid paying tax for doing business in the UK. That means they operate here and don't contribute to funding our society. Additionally, these corporations pay our government and other influences in order to sway or manipulate our legislation. This is called lobbying and is very problematic worldwide issue. Lobbying is widely referred to a corruption of the diplomatic process. These corporations also only care about growth and profit. That's not because they're evil bastards who want to see the world burn. They're everday people doing their job for a company to make a living. It just so happens that to make a company profitable, cutting corners unless madated by law, polluting or exploiting labour are all things that drive profits. So it's a consequence of trying to operate a successful business that you need to use these exploitations, if you don't another company will and they will have lower costs or more effective agency in making business. In short, capitalism is very problematic, and a well known and observed issue in many countries. 

* Governance - we in theory use 'democracy' here in the UK. We're not going to get political here or too critical because we don't want to incite rampant strawman fallacy. But we already covered where capitalism significantly impedes a proper process of democracy. We also need to consider the power of information. In simple terms, we **voted to leave the EU** by a vote of 51.9% in favour of leaving. But what does that mean? Well people went to the voting polls and decided. But what did they decide? *That's the question*. People knew they were voting to either remain in the EU or leave it. But there's a lot of evidence to support the idea that people didn't really know what *""leave""* meant or what *""remain""* meant. The way people were ""informed"" on both campaigns was via a plethora of ways. There was rampant disinformation campaigns in full force. To keep this argument layman friendly I'll have to summarise a little, but for a long time it's been normal for governments to use *significant public manipulation* techniques to convince people as part of some agenda. That sounds worse than it is, it could just be their speech writer. In any case, no serious academic would consider the UK's government to be a proper democratic one. Whether it be through lobbying, disinformation, corruption or whatever else, our implementation of democracy is hugely problematic. It's interesting because I regularly see people comparing their democractic countries to a communist one or something similar, but actually do we actually implement democracy? 

There's many more institutions which make up our governance and participation in society. We looked at just two today. And while some of the issues presented are debated and opinions divide. It's not important for us to split hairs on these today. For the purposes of this thread all we need to consider is that our leading institutions in the UK aren't faultless. You could argue on both sides of the scale, you could say any kind of capitalism in going to inherently fundamentally lead to corruption or exploitation. You could also say that ""no perfect system exists, naff off"". Both arguments hold merit but again, neither is important right now.

***So what is important?***

What's *ABSOLUTELY* vital is that the UK people have a mechanism where they can discuss their governance. We are *ALLOWED* to say we don't like our institutions. Free speech and criticism of our government and dominant global models are *MASSIVELY intrinsically and historically* important for the development of progressive society.

It's absolutely pivotal that, in order to develop and interate on how we want our governance to operate we have free speech. 

A government that is allowed to dictate what is allowed online is a government with complete control over the country with no oversight or critique. A government which bends tech-platforms rules around ""their interpretation"" can at will label things ""conspiracies"" or ""fake news"" or silence people. 

Additionally, governments use their data on you. Actually let me rephrase **your data on you** to create patterns and models about you. For decades they've used agencies like https://i2group.com/ to collate and analyse you. Social Media (the science not the apps) tells us that if your friend smokes, you're more likely to smoke. It also tells us that if you're friend has a friend who smokes that you don't know, that you are also more likely to smoke. 

The *government use these meta analytical information on you* to justify whether they're allowed to investigate you. If your friend, friends into drugs then they can justify impeding your privacy to go through your data. 

**And the more data we give them, the more tigher their control is**

Did that sound like a conspiracy rant? Don't worry it was supposed to. Honestly, [Morgan Freeman says it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5EM3pd4Y6w). We genuinely should be scared about this. It's healthy to be fearful of the power a government has.

# So in defence of the bill

The bill breaks several new precedents and provides the government with 'total control' over it's people. But is that so bad? It would make things very hard for terrorists or robbers. It would make it that % more safer for your child using the net. 

Also, this is a very problematic area. Trying to ""solve"" online enforcement is insurmountable. We have to start somewhere and while the bill isn't perfect it makes a first good try. Let's pass it and develop it if we need? You can trust we have your best interest in mind as we develop it. 

Ultimately, as long as we ""trust"" the government, it's ok right?

# So in conclusion

When we ""need to trust"" an entity, history has shown that's a very vulnerable and problematic situation to be in which has historically been exploited. 

I think Amnesty International (Human Rights charity) put it eloquently: 

> It remains undeniably true that it is not possible to create a technological system that can scan the contents of private electronic communication while preserving the right to privacy.

> - Rasha Abdul Rahim, Amnesty International

As you derive your own opinion let me frame a question to you. Are you against Royalty? A lot of people are against them because they didn't ""earn"" their position, they just get a lot of tax money for free because of who their parents are. If you don't like Royals, can I invite you to question, is our ""primeminister"" any different, if they have control over public opinion and intimate deep insights into our societies psyche. If you were critical of that government, can you trust them to allow you to voice that opinion within the confines of what they consider ""conspiracies"" or ""fake news""? 

But let's consider one last facet of this bill. The ""bad people"" doing actual crime like sending abuse pictures or messages. The ""evil do'ers"" buying drugs and discussing flat earth conspiracies and spreading *fake* antivaxing content. They can still do all that using VPN's and novel mechanisms to bypass the government restrictions. People will move to other tech platforms. People and how they send information is one of the fastest moving and rapidly evolving things in the world. With respects to the mighty british government - this bill wont stop that.

So who would it impact? Well it would impact you, it would capture and scan everything you do. It's aimed at the people who ""dont have time to worry about this"" .. ""I have nothing to hide"" etc. It would judge and analyze content. It would be stored and available to be known about you. It would give the government significant means of control over what you're allowed to read and write, about your news. 

The government knows this as well. So it's interesting to speculate on why exactly they might want to pass this.

Ultimately, whatever colour your skin is, however you identify, by which name you call god, or not, to which influencers you agree with, which papers you read or by which political party you fall into.

Your a human and as a human your ability to exercise your freedom, volition and your ability to self inform on events will be significantly threatened either directly by the bill, indirectly, or by the precedents being set. 



But in the end, you're one last other thing. You're the judge.

Reddit,"Find it hilariously sad that the Brexit machine has swung ""project fear"" back against remain when the original ""project fear"" was used by the leave campaign to scare people through misinformation into voting leave in the first place. You remember the scare stories we were told about the EU right?. I find it hilarious that leavers scream project fear about everything whether it is based in facts or not, whether it is based upon a growing trend that can be show such as the large business leaving the country, closing down factories or moving their offices to the mainland, the £600m a week the UK is worse off from as a result of Brexit.

The entire Brexit movement was a right wing fear project. Remember how people were told Turkey were going to join, that there would be a million Turks charging towards the English border, Farage showing his poster about all the migrants, how we were being forced into a European army. They used fear and now try to label inconvenient truth as project fear. They used the idea that in the EU we were not powerful despite the fact that in the EU we held a seat at the table, we held the ability to veto such things as Turkey joining, we held a say over policy that would effect us. Being out of the EU in no ways changes these things, the EU is a massive trading block that to deal with we are going to have to negotiate with and one way or another we are effected by what happens on the mainland continent.

Why would people that want to stay in the EU shut up and how do you not see the irony in daring to call anything we say a project fear? When we have been dragged out on lies, even your own lead politicians the very night of the referendum started to backtrack on claims they made? Whether you are so deep in denial that you refuse to see it, or whether it is merely because it has failed to effect you quite yet there are many factors that are proving Brexit to be detrimental to the country. I also fail to understand how anyone looks at the likes of JRM and finds any fiber of comfort or inspiration in what he says or what he does, he is a rich boy who will be unaffected by leaving the EU, how anyone can think he is representing the country baffles my mind.

The fact that this was supposed to be the easiest divorce in history, the trade deals would be easy and the whole world would be lining up to trade with us and yet here we are nearly 3 years later and we have what to show for it? If is not fear to say that we are in a weak position, it is a fact to say so.

The truth is, it is the leave side that is still using the fear to keep the electorate in line, the fear of hearing and seeing the truth behind an action that is damaging us as a country and as a society. You are fearful of seeing and admitting the truth and choose to dismiss everything else out of hand.

Reddit,"Why I'm Gving Up on UK News Outlets.. I'm mixed raced (white/black) and suffer from pretty severe mental health issues. 

I've always been pretty left wing. A lot of that will be to do with how much abuse my parents generation on the black side and the stories and warnings we grew up with (my mum is 56, I am 31 for context), our education and coming from a poor background to emerge successful, all of us holding degrees we've earned because of our intellect, not positive discrimination as so many have told us. 

Now, as we live on a time where ""racism doesn't exist"" and the abuse of previous generations that create poorly presented, quite dislikable creatures like Diane Abbott (yet many white folks of her generation refuse any and knowledge that people like my mum and Diane Abbott may have suffered prolonged verbal, and, in my mums case, multiple, life long scarring violence by their peers and their seniors...who wonder why millennial minorities are so loud a out race issues. Some of your parents helped cause them...and we are the consequence of those actions), I can no longer read the news without wanting to hang myself or throw myself infront of oncoming traffic.

UK news outlets are profiting off of this new environment of ""free speech without impunity"" in comments sections, and via figures like Katie Hopkins, and, what used to be heated healthy debate has become vindictive and ugly to the point where my already bad health is becoming increasingly unstable.

Call me a coward if you will, but should I really feel like this in my home country in 2016 and have to wake up and see this distrust of me thrown in my face everytime I turn on either a TV, pick up my phone or boot up my laptop? 

How much time is really worth spending on defending myself or any other minority from abuse every day only for more people to shout down simple platitudes like ""don't generalise people"" or ""not every ""x"" is a bad person"" and told I'm some crazy fascist liberal because I don't think ""fucking raghead"" is a particularly useful phrase.

Knowing that deep down millions are fine with racially profiling me because some brown men commit more crime than their lighter counter parts is soul destroying when you've run out of energy to fight. 

I guess I just want to share why people like me exist, and that words on the internet Starr off in real human minds, and why I think UK news has become physically dangerous.

Free speech shouldn't make people want to cave in and die because they were born a certain way. Or is that all that is left for us who don't belong here?

I'm sure you'll say I'm projecting some issues on to others but it's this particular issue that is making me watch my back when I leave the house again.

Last time I did that, it was after being beat up in a racially motivated attack 14 years ago.

Reddit,"*update* uk employment scam ""chequepoint"". 
Ok so for those of you who have been following you can reference the other post from a few days ago. For those who have ,or have not read here’s the detailed everything.

I applied to a job for a junior admin I.T position on gum tree. The advert contained no company reference no address or phone number. I received a call on the Friday from a guy named Vincent asking me to an interview on Monday I agreed. Was told to wait for the email with the directions to the interview and should have it in a few min I waited and nothing happened after 20 min so I called the number back and it was a dead number. Weird... No big deal so I looked the phone number up wasn’t really pulling any information so I looked up the phone numbers registered information it did give a persons name but it was connected to some other company but it did have an address approx. location (83 Gloucester road) weird. Within a few min after that I got the email with directions 85 Gloucester road London for 1pm as well as the interviewers name Kristina and an alternate phone number (which did work for inbound calls) but the other number was an outbound only number) I had already worked that out.

So I began researching chequepoint and my, my... big red flags looking back. Do I believe all the comments? With a grain of salt fir sure even after my experience but overall all I feel most if not all comments about that company are pretty accurate. I especially loved the one of the past hr. person using a pseudo name to defend the company then a few weeks later she showed back up to post a company trashing 10 rules of chequepoint post. A must read btw ;)

Keeping that in mind I made a decision to keep an open mind be smart document my experience and see where the truth falls. And if the place chequed out (ha-ha get it) I was going to write my experience of the hiring process here regardless of the outcome and give updates. #forscience and to set at least an honest recent personal account straight.

On Monday I went to the interview I was on time they were not (10 min late). I am a pretty prompt person but no big deal interviews are generally never on time. A guy came out (must have been interviewed before me) and a blonde lady named Kristina took me to a back room on the ground floor. The place was outdated dark and a smell of mold dust and damp was very present.

During the interview Kristina told me vague things about the job only asked me 2 things about my past employment history. I told her and she was quickly lost when I briefly mentioned some of the I.T Work I have been involved with. (You could tell she was not an i.t person and knew very little just enough to do her job but that was it) she didn’t even know what VoIP was... During the interview no mention of payment method/frequency and wages. So I asked at the end she said that’s discussed during 2nd interview. I said np thank you she asked if I had any more interviews I truthfully told her yes I had one the following day she said she would let me know by Tuesday.

Tuesday I got a phone call from Kristina she asked me my expected wages I told her its dependent on how many hours if I’m expected to be on call and how much responsibility I would have but I low balled it and told her AT MINNIMUM 8.25 per hour. She said ok np can I call you back in 30. I said fine 30 min later she called me she sounded excited and she gave me a verbal offer on the phone carrot trick told me my offer letter would be sent out by end of day tuesday. I stayed calm on the phone Kristina was more excited than I let on deep down I was hoping it was real and I was a bit excited too. Just before we completed the call Kristina slyly told me that for all new hires we have to go on self-employment for first month and she said everyone does it she did it blah blah. Red flag. She asked if I was ok with it I hesitantly said sure. I later called back and asked more details about self-employment and why not payroll she told me it’s the way it is there. No offer letter Tuesday.

Wednesday... no offer letter.. So around 5pm I sent an email requesting my expected start date and time (I’m quite organized and put everything into my calendar)

Thursday I got a call from Kristina apologizing they got so busy yada yada offer letter would be sent by end of Thursday yada yada and she asked me to come in Friday to sign employment contract and she would show me around tell me about the job and she has an even better job planned for me carrot trick #2 I questioned her about the self employment again she assured me its just temporary yada yada (she spoke very, very fast which I guess is a confuse tactic? Anyways I agreed I would show up next day to see what it was all about. Still no offer letter by end of Thursday.

Friday. Was pretty hesitant on even going but #forscience I went to see what it was about. I arrived on time; prompt as usual this time they were on time however instead of Kristina it was a younger girl maybe a student for summer work? Anyways I had asked to use the washroom I was showed upstairs and it was kind of weird, carpets like a house not an office really. Crappy furniture but hey its a recession jk a room on second floor with boxes and stuffed birds it was weird finally on 3rd floor an office area that looked crowded and had what looked like few to many people crammed in there. I saw Kristina but she was busy. Went into the washroom did my business and well I’m not superstitious but the toilet kind of woke me up to the idea of paying attention for signs. The toilet was so mangled and crappy (no pun intended) it needed 5 flushes just to clear the very little I had even put in there and in-between each flush the water refilling time was like a min between flushes yea that was a sign. I couldn’t help thinking before they hire more staff they should hire a plumber and get that crapper fixed (pun intended)

Anyways went downstairs the young girl showed me to the poorly lit interview room I had already been acquainted with and gave me a bunch of papers to review (my contract) asked me to review and sign. Pretty sure on the wall there is a radio microphone and the odd tapestry on the one wall was covering something like a window to a hidden room or dunno it was weird. Well first page was that offer letter. But it was not for a junior it admin position but ""deputy custodian"" of Berkley safety deposit boxes I was like wtf. Oh and pay rate? 8.20 instead of 8.25 which was not even the already self low balled MINIMUM I had requested not knowing hardly anything about what it was I would be doing and that was before she mentioned anything about self employment. On the phone on Tuesday.

So I took the pen they gave me and made the corrections that would need to be changed before I signed anything. Major screaming red flags in my head at this point. I further read on loads of purposefully confusingly worded ""legal"" jargon I went line for line and penned anything I had an issue with i.e. breaches of legality, discrimination, and just messed up stuff. All throughout I was referenced as "" he"" or ""she"" or ""her"" or, he/ her it was pretty hilarious at this point at how unprofessional this company was. One quote from the legal bits that I found to be a breach of discrimination towards anyone really was: "" you warrant you have no serious physical or mental illness"" Its a grey area for open discrimination you cant legally say that in a contract and this opens a wide door for possible abuse, and unlawful termination of employment.

Another part, which is a bit to type, said this in short

""By signing this contractual agreement you agree that payments may be deducted from your paycheck without your approval in the event suspect of theft or anything else regardless of if you committed the crime or not. We don’t need a court order as you agreeing to this by signing contract allows us to do this.""

Huge red flag. I have a clean record and good credit I will not sign a contract agreeing to that that’s just stupid unlawful even under uk employment standards. Should anything happen Go through correct legal avenues police report EVIDENCE than take that person to court to get we it is they may/not have taken. That sub clause basically is chequepoint trying to circumvent the legal system. RED FLAG

The last sub clause i willl mention is the cute point about not having any free speech. In detail: Not being able to talk about chequepoint or subsidiaries on online forums to others about their contracts and rules/policy’s not to talk about staff ect. You are not to talk to press about company inner going ons etc. etc.

Bit of red flag there.

P.s I have photographic proof of every single document I will share it here tomorrow if any of you who are familiar with legal documents would like to take a look and give your opinions.

Anyways I didn’t sign anything I made my notes made Kristina aware will only sign if I’m on payroll day 1 of employment not self employment and I told her its tax evasion and avoidance of paying BASIC and rightfully owed employee benefits.

She explained my actual job would be the safety deposit box department manager and I would be in charge if the remodel and chasing up contractors and suppliers I would have 2 people under me that I would need to hire I would deal with customer contracts and agreements manage the security and it.

LMAO WUTT??? That’s not a junior it admin nor a deputy custodian that’s like a safety deposit box officer or manager wtf seriously... bullshit alert right??

She took my revised contract upstairs came back 20 min later with loads of excuses for why the contract is written that way and cant be changed I told her I want to be on pay roll if you want me so bad as you say do the legally right thing and employ me properly with those edits. She said she would let me know on Tuesday what she can do (I wasn’t holding my breath)

I checked gumtree just out of curiosity yesterday and sure enough Vincent posted a junior admin job on gumtree under admin jobs on Friday. Seems they made their decision to pry on another poor unsuspecting person. And pass me off, as I’m too much of a legal headache.

So here’s how the employment scam goes.

They need someone temporary so they offer them a job but have them on self-employment (they dodge paying taxes and benefits and pocket them. They use that person for a short period stringing them with that carrot trick they will get on payroll at end of first month. They fire them without cause short of that end of month and make a bogus claim they stole something or w.e and deduct the value of w.e that imaginary stolen w.e is and take it from their ""paycheque"" or simply don’t pay them. Grovit will fight you in court with the billions at his disposal and because you agreed to that line in your contract you screwed yourself before you even get to court.

100% scam.

Edited roughly for grammar and spelling. My apologies the original version was worked on at 3am ish with little sleep and the fact i had been under general anaesthetic for some surgery on saturday probably didnt help. Also if i may, i don't have an english doctorate in grammar and spelling i am human not a professional writer so if you fe the unecessary urger to critique my spelling and grammar as you have nothing else productive in your life to do so be it, but i dont really care. I wanted to just get my experiance out there for educational purposes and to help those for prevantative measures and wake people aware of how this particular employment scam works.",2016-08-14

Reddit,"Fixing Broken Britain (UK) - /r/uK a new political party. After the poostorm that has become of labour and UK politics I'm honestly sick and tired of the ""Eton massive"" controlling our lives acting as if they know us, when they dont know a single thing about the people of UK. I'm making this thread, which prolly no one will read, to MAKE and faux political party from /r/uK (hypothetical) and asking each of you to post what would [if you were a leader/ member of FBB] be your policies. 

Disclaimer: im not saying being super rich, and having a heir to millions or living in a bubble away from the rest of society makes you not empathetic to their troubles whilst you eat caviar sip and on mulled wine and never ever have to worry about the bills being paid (lol im not sour bois and girls), but in my opinion this government have proved to be so out of touch with the UK its ridiculous. Im not a UKIP fan or supporter, but I have to acknowledge why almost 2 million of the voting public wanted a purple flag in downing street. 

Anyways I will get started on what i think the FBB (fixing broken britain party) should do:

For less reading just ctrl + f: [Utility Policy], [National], [NHS], [Education], [Jobs], [Benefits], [Immigration] and [Crime] and read what you think it most important. Im not left or right wing. Im british wing. 

**1) [Utility Policy]** Heavy Nuclear power investment. We will have nuclear weaponery primed for anything to happen to UK, but we are afraid of it doing good and powering our homes??? okay. the uk, as an island, has the perfect conditions for nuclear power plants. we do not get as extreme weather as other countries (cite - quakes, tornados, tsunami etc etc) and i trust british engineering and physicists to design a robust nuclear power plant (to POWER the whole of the UK) for a lifetime. 

Make a new company called ""uk power"" which will be a TAX PAYER OWNER company which will run the plant. A contract will be written where this will be in tax payer ownership for the next 500 years or never sold ever. This will DRAMATICALLY reduce cost of electricity, gas and water (almost all utilities) which will also be nationalised. meaning they will not work for gross fat pig profits but fair pricing for EVERYONE. they will first be rolled out to all majority cities whereas smaller villages will be run on solar power/ wind alongside battery farms (the ones elon musk and tesla are developing -we can do that too) and the solar farms will be 100% make of recycled material. 

nuclear waste? still contains a bulkload of its energy - can be stored for selling to our space program or reused in smaller nuclear power plants. the amount of nuclear waste, compared with oil/ coal/ gas plants is NOTHING relate to the amount of energy it will produce and has almost zero impact on global warming. And each nuclear power plant will have a remote battery assembly plant which will siphon off excessive power and be stored so IF there is any power cuts (usually in small towns or villages) we can use them as backups. any profits made in the company will be invested back into the uk tax payer. we will end that stupid changed day and night rate. 

This will LITERALLY fix our energy ""crisis"" overnight (figure of speech will takes couple of years to build the plants). Firstly it WILL put an end to complete oil and coal plants/ energy usage for main cities and towns. This means we can stop buying oil from rich arab nations, as we stupidly do now, reducing the amount of money we spend on oil and thus decreasing the value of paying for electricity through oil imports. It will decrease the use of russian gas and putins stranglehold on us. Why the hell are we still importing energy utilities when are are smart enough and have the money to do it ourselves and the pros outweigh the cons? 

It will also mean that electricity will be much more widespread in usage and a greater density is being formed. Complete overhaul of ""petrol stations"" now including rapid charging points for cars. For now hybrid cars, with both battery and tank for petrol, will be the best bet until we can make battery technology much better and incorporate large areas on our motorways which are able to ""wirelessly charge"" our car batteries as we drive over them thus increasing the range. 

This means CHEAP AS ******** FUEL FOR YOUR CAR. No more paying 100 pounds to fill your ""hungry"" car. no MORE being at the mercy of global oil prices causing peaks and troughs for your per litre price. no more worrying about getting a car because ""the cost of fuel will be too much"". get that damn car you want. and btw FBB will cut road tax on ALL purely electric cars, and reduce it massively for hybrid cars. AGAIN the profits made from the energy company will be put back into the tax payer and will be used for massive discounts on the already cheap price for being able to charge your car. 

Cheaper electricity en masse means cheaper water cheaper EVERYTHING. Companies overheads will go down, as will utilities like water AND PHONE/ INTERNET ETC because they are paying MUCH MUCH less for their electricity. and by nationalising all utilities we're able to lower the bills for NOT MILLIONS but everyone. lower water, lower phone bill, lower broadband etc. This will also mean that the cost of living will also go down... and that now if we were to restart industry in this country... THE major overhead.. electricity would go down making the cost of making the product lower. Lower electricity cost also means MUCH LOWER train prices.

**2) [National]** Renationalise EVERYTHING. Transport, telecomms, water, electricity (british gas) EVERYTHING that was sold get it back from the pigs trotters. Get rid of stupid ""line rental"" for BT customers (when renationalised) and for other telecoms companies to make it fairer on the UK person. Enjoying that 30 pound a month 100mb internet which other countries get for 1 gig? ye enjoy 16 pound line rental.

Reduce the price of broadband and make it MORE competitive for the tax payer (im talking 250mb for 20 pounds, it can be done). a lower cost of public transport is the ONLY WAY to increase productivity into the city and reduce carbon emissions. because you increase the likelihood of people actually using it. Basically this is just bread and butter, stop people ripping off the british person because they want to make £££ and buy a nice boat and keep prices low and affordable at the same time as make money to REINVEST into infrastructure, BETTER PIPES, BETTER CABLES FOR BROADBAND, better TRAINS etc etc. 

**3) [NHS]** - Remove every POS manager and do a proper top down restructure. do it ONLY ONCE in its lifetime. it will hurt like hell but its needed. Put in people, ideally doctors or nurses, who have been WORKING IN the hospital who know how the bloody thing works in charge as the health secretary, not some career gutless politician who has no clue and thinks doctors and going on holiday every weekend. Put people with interests in the healthcare of our country at the top, not pen pushers or business men. hospitals are not a political playground nor a business, dont make it one. reduce the pay of nhs managers. they will still get a nice salary, but it wont be ego inflated. 

reduce the levels of managers in the nhs, removing a lot of red tape and pen pushing to get things done and changed much quicker without it being costly to the tax payer. GOVERNMENT RUN UTILITIES ONLY for NHS. Assures cheaper overheads, easing a lot of financial pressure on hospitals and making sure no gross misconduct of finance is committed (paying like 10k for 100 light bulbs because it goes on a ""yes"" conveyor belt). Stock the hospitals with BRITISH industry run items. Ill go over this in detail but we will make industry back again in this country. **** the cartel and their planned obsolesce bs. this is england. this is britains. this is uk. we will make the best light bulbs you ever seen and they will last for decades if they have to. reducing cost of buying material for hospital maintenance, again lowering overheads. Again making medical equipment in UK also, and reducing import tax so that medical equipment is cheaper to buy for the hospitals, reducing overheads. 

Putting an end to the way we have outsourced medicine to private agencies who pay doctors of the same grade as NHS doctors almost double the salary. they will be on the same salary. however fixing the finance of the NHS means more hospitals and more doctors per head. giving nurses that damn pay rise they should have had decades ago. and ill stop this ***** ""but youre not a doctor"" culture that attacks our nurses. they should be treated with respect as human beings. bringing the trash doctors off their pedestals and highlighting more our GOOD doctors. limiting the medical duality with which a lot of senior doctors do which is fatten their NHS paycheck with private practise. you will be limited to doing this, the NHS is your 1# priority and if you dont like you, youll be asked to go either private or NHS. you dont get into medicine for money. RE-OPENING AnE departments which were closed (for what reason?) reducing the stress of AnE departments which were flooded. educating patients on ""out of hours gp services"" and making sure many practises adhere to it. many british tax payers arent going to AnE for a laugh... theyre going there because they work in the day and at night some of their practises are closed. making EU citizens PAY for their own treatment ACROSS the board and banning the use of british european health insurance cards by anyone OTHER THAN UK born nationals. 

stop cuts and secure the mental health and social care services in the country to prevent backlogging into hospitals. cutting this will ALWAYS cause filtering and funneling issues in hospital beds (yeye there's more people in the country, but medicine has changed the life expectancy for the better we ARE getting older, better healthcare). when an old person is taken care of and need to go back home, but need after care there needs to be a place they can go. currently due to cuts it takes a ***** ton of time to free up beds. hospitals should be a place where people get better, not where they are stuffed in corridors waiting 4 hours for scans and beds. standardise care across the board, although ofc different areas of britain will have different medical conditions more prominent than others they need to handle. 

The main thing is educating people about out of hours and TEACHING youngs kids to look after themselves. The main point is reducing stress across the board so doctors ONLY need to worry on the patients and not check boxes. 

**4) [Education]** - LET TEACHERS ***** TEACH. they are NOT parents, they are NOT police. any parents that cant be arsed to educate and teach their bundle of joy manners, they wont get put into the ""special school"" for kids who misbehaved they will go straight into military cadets or they will just learn a vocation for industry. stop wasting tax payer money on trying to discipline someone elses kid cus they were too horny or cba to be a parent. these days kids are so self entitled its ridiculous, and there's too much of an education gap between the rich and the poor. there will be two pathways. vocation or education. 

you either pick up a trade or you go academically. forcing a child that cba with education and making them get gcses wont do a single thing, get them in vocation of the factories grafting (obviously when they are of legal age to work in factories). stop this ""you need to have a 2:1 or first to teach"" bs. people who have that kind of degree are going to go to the city. let people who HAVE A PASSION for teaching teach. stop teaching kids complete bs. the maths taught should be a balanced mix of lifestyle maths (mortgage repayment, interest,  % discount ratios etc etc) and engineering maths (pythagoras etc) and scientific maths (dilutions, moles, ratios again etc) preparing for the real world or prospective jobs. 

reintroduce as default social skills and houseskill development in schools. cooking, sewing, ironing, woodwork AS DEFAULT. get them doing electronics young as hell so they know they dont need trash something that cost £400 with a busted capacitor and buy a new one, but pay £5 for a set of capacitors to fix it. and then as default teach them society. whats acceptable and not in society (aka murder rape UK laws drug etc) so even if their parents didnt teach them, they will know something. teach them HISTORY BY DEFAULT. that will teach them about different cultures and the human race. scrap this accelerated learning bs where a two year old can do gcses or something stupid like that. you cant accelerate through like. its like a mature cheddar, tastes stronger more mature it gets. let kids be kids leave the educating to us. for outstanding kids, after school classes or weekend classes can be taught which teaches them a harder version of the basics taught in school. dont jump but go DEEP. get grammar schools back and and get state schools and public school on par with private schools. the object of schools is to educate humans. objective of parents is for boundaries and discipline (parent school relationship wise). Stop this BS ""boys will be boys"" attitude towards bullying. ANY BULLYING is wrong and should be severely punishment. there should be no place for it in society. 

Destroy the current exam system. i mean we will DESTROY IT.  total and utter vapourisation. make state exams EVERYONE has to sit. no bullshit private american controlled exam boards, STATE WIDE exams which everyone has to. no bs one school does one exam board another does another. if youre all competing for the same place at uni it should not be down to which exam board has it ""easier or harder"". One exam board for the STATE. keep in mind by this time those that dont want to continue education are already in vocation or military cadets, so those who do stay should be serious about their education. get rid of coursework. instead have project based learning. ""build me a model of the universe"". ""show me the use of this chemical in todays society"" etc etc. There should be ""mid terms"" in Jan which allow students to take pressure of final exams. 

But ofc this mid terms will be very light and aid students to work towards a goal. Exams should be 50% theoretical 50% practical. not 50% coursework 50% written bs that goes on or other. but the practicals should not be under exam pressure. it should be a continuous observation. the theoretical should ALWAYS be more application (depth of knowledge) rather than breath. It reflect our society today where you are stuffing a kid with so many facts to memorise yet they will ONLY use a fraction of it in real life. make them DEEP THINKERS rather than brainless sheep who are only good at memorising pages. 

all school meals should be FREE and freshly cooked. Student should be allowed to be which sport or after school activity they want to engage with, and make a club format like in Japan where student pick and join a club. dont force a kid to do a sport which they despise and humiliate them for not being good at it. let them pick and try out what they find FUN and let them do it. thats the only way to get a kid active and make them carry it on towards the rest of their lives (i.e i despised football but loved swimming and martial arts, but there was neither in my school. Swimming was only in first 2 years only one term). 

First aid teaching as standard to all primary school kids. Scrap uni courses which lead to dead ends and make uni degrees FREE OF CHARGE. YEP. suck it. 

**5) [Jobs]**- British first, regardless. Implosion in factory and industry meaning MILLIONS more jobs for brits. And we will build exclusion housing for people who work in factories just like china have done, but we will do it better. Build a new car factory from the ground up and make bmw/ mercedes competitive cars 100% british made. 0 export tax for british made produce so we can sell and export to the commonwealth, Americas, oceania, eurasia and china better. make a tiered system, luxury cars, but GOOD QUALITY high volume cars. this will add jobs. need to make people PROUD to work in british industry, need to make it a viable lifestyle. again lower cost of living will fix this and free housing. 

Reopening the coal mines and doing it in a 21st century method. Mine the coal. Coal is one of the earths most valuable CARBON sources. used in a crap ton of material not just for burning. we will export it as a carbon source making ££ for uk economy alongside our industry. we wont frac. i will make it illegal to hire illegal people and use them as slave on a disgusting salary so they are forced to live 20 in one room. Jobs will go to brits first, and literally if brits dont want them ONLY THEN will they will be filled elsewhere. and you will have to sign saying you, as a british citizen, dont want the job and for what reason. need to give tax cuts to ANYONE in a job and giving them perks (like % discount on the cars or goods at the factory they work at) so that having a job > living off benefits. 

stop giving apprenticeships like crisps. you need to make THE JOB PLACES FIRST before training people and them realising there's no jobs for them in the trade. offer better streamlined support for those who are unemployed because they have medical conditions etc (SOME of this workforce can still do basic computer based work). the bulk of the fit unemployed, send them off to our army and get them involved in the british forces (i will expand on this later i have big plans for uk army). shut down tax dodgers and havens and greedy corps to claw back money. you dont give a man fish everyday until your money runs dry, you teach him to fish and show him the way to the ocean so he can sustain himself for life. 

put an end to the ""its who you know"" culture. make equality for brits applying for jobs. 

**6) [Benefits]** - Cut child support off at 2 children, across the board. Some couple cant even have kids but have to pay tax to support people with 5 plus kids who they themselves cant afford them? please dont joke. have kids that you can afford. dont expect others to pay for them. make orbital cities outside of cities with good links to cities which are full of council housing. NOT TOWER BLOCKS. make them decent well equipment small - medium houses. full bricked, not this new age bs cost cutting. you can make a wicked home for 100k. make parks and beautiful area surrounding them.

dont let kids in council houses grow up in shiit neighbourhoods with no where to properly play so they get into drugs and gangs. let them grow in space. and no im not segregating them from the major cities, im keeping them out of the stressful cluttered city life for a specific reason to do with their mentality and well being. im against stuffing humans in council high rise blocks making them miserable. but keep them connected to the cities for job prospects shopping etc. the WHOLE POINT of doing this is to stop one thing. and thats by en masse AFFORDABLE HOUSING. yep, not putting them in a 2 million pounds london house with like 10k a month in council rent which the TAX PAYER pays. give them a government owned council house BUT WHICH they CAN buy when they are in a better financial situation HOWEVER the house prices will be locked on these houses so they cant make profit by increasing house prices. ill close this right to buy bs too, someone getting pot lucky buying a million pound worth house for barely nothing because the tax payer put up the brunt is bs. 

benefits should always be given to those most vulnerable in our society. like giving pensioners free buss passes and what not i will put a limit on that so that those who are millionaires or comfortable dont get one. stopping flagrant abuse of benefits, limiting the amount of council house benefits paid (stopping people living in 3k a month houses courtesy of the tax payers) and CHARGING THE PERSON LIVING IN IT for destruction and not keep it tidy. Converting the existing benefit system into a voucher/ ticket based system where you get a food voucher (like in us) so it cant be used for flash cars, expensive electronics and other bs. and before anyone says anything by making the system completely fair is how it should be as default, its not punishing anyone and even if it was stopping someone subsidising their life into luxury when they cannot afford it isnt unfair on anyone. 

being on benefit should not be a lifestyle, thus giving people the EXACT benefits the require and then giving it to them through vouchers (for food, clothing, prepaid electric and water etc) instead of a gross lump sum of money is the way it should be so they are spending it on the essential they need to require to LIVE.
this will cut abuse and allow extra money in the pot for those with disabilities and for homeless brits. 

STOPPING BENEFITS to ANY non-british born person. yes british born. you can come here to the UK, free world, but youre not getting handouts. you come with your own money mates. only until you have PAID INTO THE TAX SYSTEM FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 YEARS will a NON BRITISH BORN person be entitled for access to benefits. ill no longer give out uk passports to non british born people. and btw mothers who come from other countries just to give birth, lol, your child will not get a uk passport. Non british born citizen will get an iD card with THEIR HOME COUNTRY passport number and details on it and they will get a unique number associated to them. they wont get NI number. 

you will live in UK and pay taxes through this number. this is the only method to ensure british tax payer money is ONLY paid to brits and to people who put into the system. uk citizenship will no longer give uk passports, but an ID card. easier to track people leaving and coming to the country this way. and it will stop easy access to benefits for people who have not paid into the system. other countries do not give brits the world on a platter, so we should not do the same. this isnt an anti-europe agenda. this is to ensue british society gets the money FIRST, and any surplus we have left over then can be used if available. in any society you have to look after the people within it first, get it GROWING before even thinking of accommodating others. 

**7) [Immigration]** - Lol. this was naturally coming after benefits. same applies id card system, 10 year wait putting INTO THE SYSTEM before access to benefits for migrants, eu and non. Only skilled people (refugees are not counted) must have a JOB FIRST and apply for an id card BEFORE going into UK. that job must not have been ONLY advertised in europe exclusively. they will not be put onto housing of any kind courtesy of tax payer. they will have to rent (hence why agreed job prehand allowed a pre determined wage to allow for renting). Honestly, im not anti immigration at ALL.

we are NOT full. use brain plox, 6% of Uk is urbanised for living, we just dont have the INFRASTRUCTURE to accommodate. which is why until we do (until ive built GOOD HOUSES for brits first and done everything above which is why i left this till last) we will restrict immigration from outside EU and EU. however what can be put into effect IMMEDIATELY is the id card and only offering the health insurance to brit born so they KNOW theyre not getting handouts par non. that way the british community should know that these people are not coming here for benefits so that discussion can finally be popped. 

**8) [Crime]** - putting council houses in better land areas (outside of cities) with enough space for families to GROW and get free education will reduce crime. those who dont want education, put them into military cadets like the old days. i will make a bigger MILITARY POLICE force which will help the regular police and we be on a salary. they will go into all communities and help people and be a bigger presence. ending this stockholm syndrome culture some of us are under about our criminals. i will built megaprisons OFF SHORE and literally consult a ""human rights"" lawyer so i am barely breaking UN humans rights law in designed the prison. they will not live together in cells but microcells and have BASIC FOOD FOR SURVIVAL. protein manufactured cheaply etc. water only. NO **** GYM ACCESS. yes lets make robbers, who couldn't afford gym, stronger by free gym access in prison. prison will be a HELL that no criminal will want to even return to. thats how you make prison a deterrent. in many southern asian countries they literally starve prisoner so they can barely hold their hands up again.  if it was up to me id do that too, but even in britain criminals have humans rights... even if that includes murderers removing the human right of a person to live... but the mega prisons will be simple. in a cold dark room every day, meals, THATS IT. no socializing so they can make better gang connections once they get out. 

and no more mickey mouse sentences. they need to expensive hell, thats the only way to rehabilitate and make them not re-commit crimes. if they think prison is a joke, whats the point? 


**TL;DR *nuclear power stations; cheaper electricity cheaper everything. make more factories, makes mores jobs more industry. reduce import export tax, close all tax loopholes claw money from multinationals.
renationalise services. build more affordable houses, brick built. better public transport, skyrail, trams etc. 
let teachers teach, teach more lifestyle at schools (cooking etc) shove badkids to military/ jobs.
fix the nhs by stopping abuse and making it efficient, no more check boxes and red tape. 
stopping benefit abuse, turning cash into voucher to redeem.
give perk to tax payers, make uk passport impossible for non brit borns, implement id cards. 
reopen coal mines and export it, export our oil more. 
make megaprisons where criminals LITERALLY rot and dont make them on social clubs for criminals*.**

interested to read your policies. ",2015-09-14 12:21:21,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3kwgoi/fixing_broken_britain_uk_ruk_a_new_political_party/,fixing broken britain uk ruk a new political party after the poostorm that has become of labour and uk politics im honestly sick and tired of the eton massive controlling our lives acting as if they know us when they dont know a single thing about the people of uk im making this thread which prolly no one will read to make and faux political party from ruk hypothetical and asking each of you to post what would if you were a leader member of fbb be your policies disclaimer im not saying being super rich and having a heir to millions or living in a bubble away from the rest of society makes you not empathetic to their troubles whilst you eat caviar sip and on mulled wine and never ever have to worry about the bills being paid lol im not sour bois and girls but in my opinion this government have proved to be so out of touch with the uk its ridiculous im not a ukip fan or supporter but i have to acknowledge why almost million of the voting public wanted a purple flag in downing street anyways i will get started on what i think the fbb fixing broken britain party should do for less reading just ctrl f utility policy national nhs education jobs benefits immigration and crime and read what you think it most important im not left or right wing im british wing utility policy heavy nuclear power investment we will have nuclear weaponery primed for anything to happen to uk but we are afraid of it doing good and powering our homes okay the uk as an island has the perfect conditions for nuclear power plants we do not get as extreme weather as other countries cite quakes tornados tsunami etc etc and i trust british engineering and physicists to design a robust nuclear power plant to power the whole of the uk for a lifetime make a new company called uk power which will be a tax payer owner company which will run the plant a contract will be written where this will be in tax payer ownership for the next years or never sold ever this will dramatically reduce cost of electricity gas and water almost all utilities which will also be nationalised meaning they will not work for gross fat pig profits but fair pricing for everyone they will first be rolled out to all majority cities whereas smaller villages will be run on solar power wind alongside battery farms the ones elon musk and tesla are developing we can do that too and the solar farms will be make of recycled material nuclear waste still contains a bulkload of its energy can be stored for selling to our space program or reused in smaller nuclear power plants the amount of nuclear waste compared with oil coal gas plants is nothing relate to the amount of energy it will produce and has almost zero impact on global warming and each nuclear power plant will have a remote battery assembly plant which will siphon off excessive power and be stored so if there is any power cuts usually in small towns or villages we can use them as backups any profits made in the company will be invested back into the uk tax payer we will end that stupid changed day and night rate this will literally fix our energy crisis overnight figure of speech will takes couple of years to build the plants firstly it will put an end to complete oil and coal plants energy usage for main cities and towns this means we can stop buying oil from rich arab nations as we stupidly do now reducing the amount of money we spend on oil and thus decreasing the value of paying for electricity through oil imports it will decrease the use of russian gas and putins stranglehold on us why the hell are we still importing energy utilities when are are smart enough and have the money to do it ourselves and the pros outweigh the cons it will also mean that electricity will be much more widespread in usage and a greater density is being formed complete overhaul of petrol stations now including rapid charging points for cars for now hybrid cars with both battery and tank for petrol will be the best bet until we can make battery technology much better and incorporate large areas on our motorways which are able to wirelessly charge our car batteries as we drive over them thus increasing the range this means cheap as fuel for your car no more paying pounds to fill your hungry car no more being at the mercy of global oil prices causing peaks and troughs for your per litre price no more worrying about getting a car because the cost of fuel will be too much get that damn car you want and btw fbb will cut road tax on all purely electric cars and reduce it massively for hybrid cars again the profits made from the energy company will be put back into the tax payer and will be used for massive discounts on the already cheap price for being able to charge your car cheaper electricity en masse means cheaper water cheaper everything companies overheads will go down as will utilities like water and phone internet etc because they are paying much much less for their electricity and by nationalising all utilities were able to lower the bills for not millions but everyone lower water lower phone bill lower broadband etc this will also mean that the cost of living will also go down and that now if we were to restart industry in this country the major overhead electricity would go down making the cost of making the product lower lower electricity cost also means much lower train prices national renationalise everything transport telecomms water electricity british gas everything that was sold get it back from the pigs trotters get rid of stupid line rental for bt customers when renationalised and for other telecoms companies to make it fairer on the uk person enjoying that pound a month mb internet which other countries get for gig ye enjoy pound line rental reduce the price of broadband and make it more competitive for the tax payer im talking mb for pounds it can be done a lower cost of public transport is the only way to increase productivity into the city and reduce carbon emissions because you increase the likelihood of people actually using it basically this is just bread and butter stop people ripping off the british person because they want to make and buy a nice boat and keep prices low and affordable at the same time as make money to reinvest into infrastructure better pipes better cables for broadband better trains etc etc nhs remove every pos manager and do a proper top down restructure do it only once in its lifetime it will hurt like hell but its needed put in people ideally doctors or nurses who have been working in the hospital who know how the bloody thing works in charge as the health secretary not some career gutless politician who has no clue and thinks doctors and going on holiday every weekend put people with interests in the healthcare of our country at the top not pen pushers or business men hospitals are not a political playground nor a business dont make it one reduce the pay of nhs managers they will still get a nice salary but it wont be ego inflated reduce the levels of managers in the nhs removing a lot of red tape and pen pushing to get things done and changed much quicker without it being costly to the tax payer government run utilities only for nhs assures cheaper overheads easing a lot of financial pressure on hospitals and making sure no gross misconduct of finance is committed paying like k for light bulbs because it goes on a yes conveyor belt stock the hospitals with british industry run items ill go over this in detail but we will make industry back again in this country the cartel and their planned obsolesce bs this is england this is britains this is uk we will make the best light bulbs you ever seen and they will last for decades if they have to reducing cost of buying material for hospital maintenance again lowering overheads again making medical equipment in uk also and reducing import tax so that medical equipment is cheaper to buy for the hospitals reducing overheads putting an end to the way we have outsourced medicine to private agencies who pay doctors of the same grade as nhs doctors almost double the salary they will be on the same salary however fixing the finance of the nhs means more hospitals and more doctors per head giving nurses that damn pay rise they should have had decades ago and ill stop this but youre not a doctor culture that attacks our nurses they should be treated with respect as human beings bringing the trash doctors off their pedestals and highlighting more our good doctors limiting the medical duality with which a lot of senior doctors do which is fatten their nhs paycheck with private practise you will be limited to doing this the nhs is your priority and if you dont like you youll be asked to go either private or nhs you dont get into medicine for money reopening ane departments which were closed

have left over then can be used if available in any society you have to look after the people within it first get it growing before even thinking of accommodating others immigration lol this was naturally coming after benefits same applies id card system year wait putting into the system before access to benefits for migrants eu and non only skilled people refugees are not counted must have a job first and apply for an id card before going into uk that job must not have been only advertised in europe exclusively they will not be put onto housing of any kind courtesy of tax payer they will have to rent hence why agreed job prehand allowed a pre determined wage to allow for renting honestly im not anti immigration at all we are not full use brain plox of uk is urbanised for living we just dont have the infrastructure to accommodate which is why until we do until ive built good houses for brits first and done everything above which is why i left this till last we will restrict immigration from outside eu and eu however what can be put into effect immediately is the id card and only offering the health insurance to brit born so they know theyre not getting handouts par non that way the british community should know that these people are not coming here for benefits so that discussion can finally be popped crime putting council houses in better land areas outside of cities with enough space for families to grow and get free education will reduce crime those who dont want education put them into military cadets like the old days i will make a bigger military police force which will help the regular police and we be on a salary they will go into all communities and help people and be a bigger presence ending this stockholm syndrome culture some of us are under about our criminals i will built megaprisons off shore and literally consult a human rights lawyer so i am barely breaking un humans rights law in designed the prison they will not live together in cells but microcells and have basic food for survival protein manufactured cheaply etc water only no gym access yes lets make robbers who couldnt afford gym stronger by free gym access in prison prison will be a hell that no criminal will want to even return to thats how you make prison a deterrent in many southern asian countries they literally starve prisoner so they can barely hold their hands up again if it was up to me id do that too but even in britain criminals have humans rights even if that includes murderers removing the human right of a person to live but the mega prisons will be simple in a cold dark room every day meals thats it no socializing so they can make better gang connections once they get out and no more mickey mouse sentences they need to expensive hell thats the only way to rehabilitate and make them not recommit crimes if they think prison is a joke whats the point tldr nuclear power stations cheaper electricity cheaper everything make more factories

Reddit,"The demise of the Baby Boomers will change Britain forever. Children of Baby Boomers are due to inherit £1.2 trillion from their parents, making society more unequal than ever before

Right now it’s open season on the Baby Boomers. Left-wing millennials seem to blame the postwar generation – most of whom are now pensioners – for everything from wealth inequality to the shortage of affordable housing. Indignantly they quote claims that the average pensioner now has a higher income than the average worker, that pensioners control around 80 per cent of this country’s private wealth, and that one in five pensioners is a millionaire. In their fury, however, these millennials are forgetting a small but significant fact.

Which is that Baby Boomers are not immortal.

As a result, over the next 20-30 years this country is going to experience a phenomenon that experts are calling “the Great Wealth Transfer”. According to one estimate, the children of the Baby Boomers are due to inherit an incredible £1.2 trillion from their parents.

It may seem an unlikely figure. After all, lots of pensioners don’t have all that much in the bank. But a great many of them do have a house. A house they bought decades ago, when the average property went for a fiver and a packet of crisps, but has since rocketed in value to mind-boggling heights. When they die, therefore, their children will be able to stick it on the market, and rake in the handsome proceeds. Obviously there’s inheritance tax, capital gains and so on. But there should still be a fair whack left over. And since the Boomers are by far the richest generation in history, their children will receive by far the biggest inheritance in history.

This windfall will change our society forever, for several reasons – but not all of them good. First, because the windfall won’t be equal. Some millennials will become rich overnight, while those who were born to poorer parents will get nothing. This is bound to make our society even more bitter, resentful and divided than it is now. Because instead of attacking Boomers, millennials will be attacking each other. “How can it be fair that you inherit a fortune, and I’m still penniless?” they’ll scream. “You did nothing to earn that money. Why should you get to buy yourself some big fancy house, or retire early?”

The Great Wealth Transfer may also have a dramatic effect on our politics. Put it like this. Once they inherit wealth and property, today’s Left-wing millennials may suddenly decide they aren’t so keen on socialism after all. Finally they may detect one or two upsides to capitalism, now that they have some capital of their own.

And so, to their horror, they may find themselves afflicted by a creeping temptation to vote Conservative. And not only that. Once they’ve used their Boomer windfall to buy a nice house, they may start to reconsider their constant demands for mass house-building. Out of nowhere, they may discover a deep and heartfelt passion for protecting our precious green spaces, and for preventing property developers from ruining our beautiful countryside (or at least, from ruining the view from their own houses). In short: today’s Yimbys may become tomorrow’s Nimbys.

Of course, it’s possible that the Great Wealth Transfer won’t be quite as great as experts imagine. For one thing, much of the Boomers’ wealth may ultimately get swallowed up by the costs of their care. And future Labour governments may increase inheritance tax. In which case, millennials won’t inherit very much after all.

Then again, millennials are overwhelmingly Labour voters. And if a Labour government threatens to slash their inheritance, they may threaten to stop being Labour voters. So, just as Conservative governments have repeatedly shrunk from the wrath of the Boomers, Labour governments may shrink from the wrath of the millennials.

Whatever happens, it’s bound to be bumpy. And it should confound at least one ageist prejudice.  

Many of today’s angry young Left-wingers tell themselves that once these Tory-voting Boomers are out of the way, they’ll finally be able to build a fair, just and equal society. But in reality, the demise of the Boomers may make society more unequal than ever.",2022-08-31 17:56:26,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/x2k2xo/the_demise_of_the_baby_boomers_will_change/,the demise of the baby boomers will change britain forever children of baby boomers are due to inherit trillion from their parents making society more unequal than ever before right now its open season on the baby boomers leftwing millennials seem to blame the postwar generation most of whom are now pensioners for everything from wealth inequality to the shortage of affordable housing indignantly they quote claims that the average pensioner now has a higher income than the average worker that pensioners control around per cent of this countrys private wealth and that one in five pensioners is a millionaire in their fury however these millennials are forgetting a small but significant fact which is that baby boomers are not immortal as a result over the next years this country is going to experience a phenomenon that experts are calling the great wealth transfer according to one estimate the children of the baby boomers are due to inherit an incredible trillion from their parents it may seem an unlikely figure after all lots of pensioners dont have all that much in the bank but a great many of them do have a house a house they bought decades ago when the average property went for a fiver and a packet of crisps but has since rocketed in value to mindboggling heights when they die therefore their children will be able to stick it on the market and rake in the handsome proceeds obviously theres inheritance tax capital gains and so on but there should still be a fair whack left over and since the boomers are by far the richest generation in history their children will receive by far the biggest inheritance in history this windfall will change our society forever for several reasons but not all of them good first because the windfall wont be equal some millennials will become rich overnight while those who were born to poorer parents will get nothing this is bound to make our society even more bitter resentful and divided than it is now because instead of attacking boomers millennials will be attacking each other how can it be fair that you inherit a fortune and im still penniless theyll scream you did nothing to earn that money why should you get to buy yourself some big fancy house or retire early the great wealth transfer may also have a dramatic effect on our politics put it like this once they inherit wealth and property todays leftwing millennials may suddenly decide they arent so keen on socialism after all finally they may detect one or two upsides to capitalism now that they have some capital of their own and so to their horror they may find themselves afflicted by a creeping temptation to vote conservative and not only that once theyve used their boomer windfall to buy a nice house they may start to reconsider their constant demands for mass housebuilding out of nowhere they may discover a deep and heartfelt passion for protecting our precious green spaces and for preventing property developers from ruining our beautiful countryside or at least from ruining the view from their own houses in short todays yimbys may become tomorrows nimbys of course its possible that the great wealth transfer wont be quite as great as experts imagine for one thing much of the boomers wealth may ultimately get swallowed up by the costs of their care and future labour governments may increase inheritance tax in which case millennials wont inherit very much after all then again millennials are overwhelmingly labour voters and if a labour government threatens to slash their inheritance they may threaten to stop being labour voters so just as conservative governments have repeatedly shrunk from the wrath of the boomers labour governments may shrink from the wrath of the millennials whatever happens its bound to be bumpy and it should confound at least one ageist prejudice many of todays angry young leftwingers tell themselves that once these toryvoting boomers are out of the way theyll finally be able to build a fair just and equal society but in reality the demise of the boomers may make society more unequal than ever,4,4_the_of_to_and,negative,0.6332827806472778,neutral,0.6254370212554932
Reddit,"Brits in Motorsport review for 27-29/1 and preview for 3-5/2. This past weekend there was just the one race in the 24 hours of Daytona. Next week has the 12 hours of Bathurst from the famous mount panorama circuit. I am looking for feedback- and I am wondering a few things,
  
1. do you think this would work better split in to 2 posts either side of the weekend? (do bare in mind this post covers just 2 events)

2. When do you want this up on? (I will aim for these but some may be late)

3. Do you want more of a focus on UK drivers, more general or is this about right?

4. how deep do you want this? do you want mainly results or more like this?

5. Can you think of a better title

Also feel free to ask for clarifications and explanations

#Review 

#USCR (24 hours of Daytona)

Last weekend was a really rather soggy** Daytona 24 hours** with 2 safety cars due to the amount of rain, the race however started dry but that changed before turning dry on Sunday for what was a gripping race

In the **prototype** class, In the early running Seb Morris racing in the 31 proved his talent in a stint that saw him form a 22 second lead over the teammate car in the 10 after taking the lead 30 mins in to the race which unfortunately came to very little as the car dropped to 3rd in the hand over to Curran who stalled the car that needed a push start and later suffered further problems dropping them down and out of contention. Overnight a group of 4 proved to be the drivers looking to win of the 5, 10 and 90 staying on the lead lap while the 2 car of in part raced by Scott Ryan Dalziel stayed just off it ([although did do some adverts for continenta](https://gfycat.com/GiantSparseHornshark)l) not be able to compete with the 2 Cadillac DPIs and Reliy LMP2 the 10 and 5 spent the entire race virtually together while the 90 could not maintain staying close however for sure still close. In the end want Taylor racing in the 10 beat the 5 to make it a Cadillac 1-2 and the Reliy of the lapped VisitFlorida Racing no 90 
	
As rather expected **Prototype challenge** in its last year proved to largely be an also ran with only 5 cars and moving chicane in particular in the case of the no8 car who lost control going in to the bus stop and took out a GTD leader running in 3rd at the time in[ this](http://streamable.com/rh9lh) crash which resulted in a retirement for the Porsche and a 10 minuet penalty for the PC car. The 38 and 26 were battling for much of the race until David Cheng in the 26 lost the front bodywork about 6 hours from the end and joined the list of 4 others who fell out of contention 23 laps behind  but 13 ahead of 3rd once again the class being more endurance than anything else. The final result was the 38 from the British Mowlem raced 26 and the last finisher in the class of the 20 rounds out the podium.39 laps down.

Early running in **GTLM** also suggested that the ford GTs would dominate but when the rain came the Porsche's showed their form as the fords dropped down with both Ferrari and Corvette being right in there as well however BMW lacked the speed to compete with one the first retirements in the only having done 15 laps and the other not having the speed to stay on the lead lap for much of the race. The 67 car including Westbrook and 4 with Oliver Gavin both fell out of contention along the way. Going in to 3 hours from the end there were 3 cars in contention for the win the 66 Ford lead the 62 Ferrari from the 3 Corvette from the 68 and 69 Ford and all 5 head to tail with the 911 Porsche not being too far behind although the 912 did fade more badly to drop off the lead lap. The 66 Ford beat the Porsche 911 ahead of the Ferrari of James Collardo rounding out the podium separated by 0.091 seconds while the 19 BMW of Sims managed to finish on the GTLNM lead lap which was about as much as they could expect.


**GTD** had an all new car with success with the 86 and 93 Acura's in the leading gaggle with 5 others all on the lead lap going in to the last couple of hours of the 63 Ferrari, 29 & 57 Audi, 33 Mercedes and 28 Porsche leading the 96 BMW who was 3 laps off the class lead until the leading 63 Ferrari being driven   Sam bird had an engine failure. many issues and spins for the sole Aston Martin 98 meant that while finishing it didn't really compete. Ian James who was due to race in the Lexus didn't get going when 52 laps in before he got a drive the car was crashed as he put the power down too soon  in turn 1 (see here http://streamable.com/qgwqg ) and hit the wall hard which broke the chassis beyond repair. The final result had the 28 Porsche beating the 29 Audi and the 33 Mercedes raced in part by Lichfeild born Adam Christodoulou.

#Preview

#GT one off (12 hours of Bathust)

Next weekend we come to the first one-off GT race of the year with the unkind on my sleep pattern **12 hours of Bathurst** from Australia. The race will take part on the edge of  mount panorama (after which the track is named). The track is immensely fast starting on a short strait before a much longer one going to the base of the mountain. This is where you reach one of the main overtaking spots with a heavy breaking spot before the run up the steep and twisting track which quickly speeds up for a run along the side before a tight hairpin and a run down on the fastest part of the track and a tricky down hill braking zone in to chicane awaits which is another place to watch for overtakes before a fast corner heading still down hill to the last corner. The track is for sure an unforgiving one though with very little space between the track and concrete walls. 

You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBT9K0o9-Bw&feature=youtu.be) 

I will split this in to a part for each marquee. I will say that the cars to watch are the factory cars particularly  

the defending winner **no1 Tekno Mclaren** with the only one last year's winning drivers with the team Parente being joined by Blancpain champions of  Bell and Leogard

The **no7 SRM BMW**'s strong crew of  Tony Longhurst who is both a Australian water skiing champion and 2 time Bathurst 1000 winner, Mark Skaife 5 time Aussie V8 supercar champion and 6 time Bathurst 1000 winner Russell Ingall who was a V8 championship winner and Bathurst 1000 winner (although all of whom have been retired for the last few years) and are joind by GP2 champion, F1 podium finnisher and 3 time DTM race winner Timo Glock

** 8 Bentley** with the Blancpan pairing of Steven Kane and Guy Smith are joined by fellow Brit 3 time Le Mans 24 hours 3rd place finisher and WEC runner up Oliver Jarvis make the 8 one to watch as they try to go 2 better than last year

Last years stand out driver of Shane van Gisbergen moved from Mclaren where he won the race last year as well as the blacepan endurance championship to the **22 Mercedes** alongside Mario engel and 2007 Bathurst 12 hour winner Craig Baird so this will have a lot of interest

the** 88 Maranello Motorsport Ferrari** has a 3 time V8 champion, a 6 time V8 champion and a Le mans class winner respectively in Craig Lowndes Jamie Whincup Toni Vilander, I don't think I need to say more

the **Porsche no911  911 GT3 R**  has a Le mans winning Porsche ace in earl Bamber (I think the forgotten driver of the 2015 winners) Porsche driver who with Audi has 3 GT3 championships in Lauens Vanthoor fresh from Daytona and Kevin Estre who's lack of results disguises a talented driver who has suffered at the hands of DNFs

the **74 and 75 Audi's** are packed with talent particularly the 2012 Formula Renault 3.5 champion who was unfairly snubbed by F1 as he is showing with his quality in Formula e and his GT3 championship in hid debut year in GT racing as a whole, Garth Tander who won the 2007 Aussie V8 championship, 2012 GT1 champion who lead every one of his F1 races (one being the important part of that) in Markus Winkelhock and 3 higly sucessful drivers in Hasse, Stippler and Mies 

Last years runner up of the **23 Nissan** race with Katsumasa Chiyo who has a Blancpan championship to his name along side teamate Buncombe will race the 23 alongside Caruso and will surely be fighting to go 1 place up


**
24 nissan** will take todd kelly who is yet anothe Bathust 1000 winner who will partner Jann Mardenborough who in 6 years has come a long way including a super GT win and joined by Florian Strauss who too won the acadamy like Mardenborough in 2013


I would say discount the **83 HPD Mercedes** at your perril with the 2 time lemans team of Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy, Mathias Lauda with a great in Lamy who has a fantstic record with GT championships in WEC and GT1 as well as 2 runners up spot at lemans and a class win.

first I'll cover the **A class (GT3) cars**
first up the Mclaren 650s which won here 12 months ago, last years winning team swap the Aussie pairing of  Webb and Van Geissbergen  for Come Ledogar  and geodie Rob Bell who drive for the Blancpan Mclaren team. In the other Tekno racing car V8 supercar driver will Davidson teams up with Britons Jonny Kane and Formula 3 race winner Ben . There are 2 more Mclaren, In the objective racing one 3 V8 supercar drivers (including will Davidson brother Alex) are joined by Australian GT Mclaren driver Tony walls and the Keltic racing car has a father an son pairing of Tony and Klark Quinn tony racing for the UK and Klark for Australia 

BMW have some very strong drivers in their ranks Including Ex F1 driver Timo Glock with UK born Russell Ingall with 2 more formidable touring car drivers in on car and British rising star Ricky Collard in the 99 car proving to be the entire British BMW contingent.

We next have a pair of M-sport Bentley the 8 car having a British trio including ex Audi Prototype driver Oliver Jarvis while the 17 car  has a much more continental team.

The Mercedes cars have no British interest so lets move on to Nissan with Somerset born and raised Alex Bumcome in the 23 and a driver who got his racing career thanks to grand tourismo and the driver academy that Sony did with Nissan in the 24 like his team mate who did it 2 years later

once again we skip some cars namely the audis R8, Ferrari,Porsche's and the Lamborghini and on to the  the sole Aston martin in the A class with an Australian trio

in the **B (Porsche 911 cup)** class we have 2 hopes Ben barker and James Winslow in the 4 and 50 cars

now we come on to the **C (GT4)** class where following the drivers gets hard so from here on in so I will only cover the cars which are the 56 and 69 Ginette G55 and then 62 Aston Martin V8 Vantage and finally the **Invitational class** with a Aston Martin GT8

Finally I will leave you links to calenders for UK motor racing for now I won't do a full write up for a few reasons for now, I lack the knowledge of which to cover or any insight to offer either. Most people who will want to try any of these will need a big amount of time that isn't worth covering in these. Also Putting links to the calenders usually gives you the sites with more information. I hope you understand.

Reddit,"PIP application, advice and help needed. Hi there, I'm really just feeling very overwhelmed and afraid at the moment. I hope people don't mind me posting this here.

Deep breath... on the 17th of October, just nearly 8 weeks ago, my partner of 13 years took his own life by stepping in front of a train. He had not long turned 37. He had been suffering with his mental health for many many years and had been on a downwards trajectory over the last year particularly since his mum died in March. His diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia. 

During all the time we were together I gradually took on the role of his carer with no support of my own apart from periodic visits to my GP who just dishes out pills. My own mental health diagnoses are severe depression, social phobia and anxiety, plus I have struggled in the past dating from childhood with self-harm, bulimia, anorexia, alcoholism, substance abuse and overall feelings of worthlessness and no self-esteem. I believe that this stems from an incident when I was about 9 when a male babysitter molested me, something I have only very recently begun to tell people about. I'm 36 btw.

My partner had also started to become emotionally abusive towards me during this year, I wanted to help and protect him as I loved him but I was also frightened of him and lived on tenterhooks as his feelings and attitudes towards me could change in an instant. He would repeatedly accuse me of lying to him when I wouldn't agree with his delusions about people insulting him. He accused me of drugging and poisoning him. He once pushed me onto the kitchen floor in temper, immediately saying that I'd fallen, and also threw a large mirror out the bedroom window, threw my mobile out the same window and attacked the wardrobe. A couple of years ago he was convinced that a neighbour was playing a radio deliberately to annoy him in the middle of the night and tried to leave the flat (it was part of a shared building) naked and carrying a hammer. I had to put myself physically between him and the door, and hide the key whilst he threatened to break the door down. Luckily he managed to calm down. This was in the middle of the night. In April this year he took an overdose and I sat with him in the ambulance where he spent the night in A&E. He also begged me to let him buy barbiturates to kill himself, bought a canister of helium to gas himself and put cigarettes out on the back of his hands. 

All this while he was under the 'care' of the community mental health team, a psychiatrist, a CPN and a support worker, who were worse than useless and he just had a few 'home treatments' instead of hospital admission. Before I met him in 2003, he'd been sectioned more than once and tried to kill himself a number of times. He was briefly hospitalised in September this year but on a voluntary basis and despite the efforts of me and his brother he discharged himself. 

I don't want to make this too long as I know its a lot as it is. Suffice to say that this year has been extremely difficult. I'm getting some bereavement counselling from the local hospice, as despite my circumstances the NHS can do nothing but put me on a waiting list for counselling that is 6 months at best. My parents are very supportive and live locally but I have very few local friends who could just pop by. I live alone with my cat. 

I suppose my immediate current source of anxiety is my application for PIP. I am currently in the support group for ESA, and the money is not enough for me to be able to stay in the house that for over 2 years now has been a home to me. I rent it privately from a wonderful landlady and absolutely love it here. I receive full housing benefit, however my parents who are both on a pension are currently propping up my rent and can't afford to do so long term. Hence my hope that my application for PIP will allow me to stay here, contribute towards my rent and help me start rebuilding my life. The application deadline is 30th December and has already been extended due to my circumstances. I'm going to the CAB to get help with filling the form in and going to ask my doctor for a supporting letter. I'm terrified that my application will be unsuccessful as it was a fight to be put in the ESA support group. Please does anybody have any advice or tips for me for my PIP application with particular regard to mental health, social anxiety, generalised anxiety and depression.

Reddit,"What can I do to be more british (or am I over thinking it)?. I'm 31, came to the UK in 2000, went through high school, college, and university.

I'm extremely shy.

I have cerebral palsy and speech and problems made me self conscious. I've met and seen on telly amazing disabled people, so it's not an excuse, it's just me.

Further, I'm extremely happy to be alone. I'm a happy loner. Hence, I've never had deep meaningful connections with anyone apart from my family. And due to the self-insecurities, I have never done anything: Never had to enter a pub because I don't drink or anything of sorts.

I have seen a bit of hope that I could improve my disability and so, after university, I focused on that. And I succeded! Now I feel stronger than ever before.

Now I want to become a programmer (I have the skills). Start working in Manchester hopefully, and then let my career take me where ever.

But whilst I can see myself hustling my way to an entry position, and I am British more then anything else, I've just been a shuttin, if you like, I'm scared shitless of being clueless even though I've lived most of my life here.

I'm basically a shy person due that has never allowed himself to experience the same stuff other people have, and I guess I'm trying to ask would this be a source of anxiaty in the workplace and (hopefully) in other social situations now that I really feel ready to get out there

Reddit,"Great Britain: All power now rests with Boris Johnson. A year as prime minister: In the shadow of Corona and Brexit, Boris Johnson has centralised power, degraded ministers to mouthpieces and ousted parliament.

By Bettina Schulz, London, 27.7.'20

In his opinion, it was a successful year: Boris Johnson pulled through Brexit, got his party a parliamentary majority again, led the country through the Corona pandemic, survived the virus and then also fathered a baby. That is something. If it were not for another reality.

The future of the country after Brexit still is unclear. Talks with Brussels on a free trade agreement have stalled, as have those with the United States. The UK's corona record so far is bitter: officially 45,000 dead, perhaps as many as 70,000. In relation to the population, Covid-19 has claimed more victims than in most other countries in the world.

Boris Johnson makes strong slogans, but cannot decide. He runs after the public mood. When the public is ready to accept a lockdown or masks, when the suffering is so great that Johnson no longer has to fear resistance, then he acts. Otherwise, he waits. And in the background he makes sure that nobody can take his power away from him. 

**They go further than anyone has gone before**

Almost unnoticed by the British public, in the shadow of all the major crises and loud slogans, Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings has, over the past twelve months, rigorously tailored the government apparatus to the prime minister and his small team at Number 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office. Although the latter is similar in form to the German Chancellery, it has much fewer staff. Other prime ministers have therefore already tried to strengthen their power in order to better implement their policies. But Johnson and Cummings are going further than anyone else before them.

They are not only concerned that the government should have more assertiveness vis-à-vis the bureaucracy in the ministries. They want to oust the ministers themselves and marginalise the Cabinet. Johnson and Cummings are changing the way British policy is made. Johnson's making himself President. ""It is a shift of power away from joint cabinet decisions to a government solely in the name of the Prime Minister,"" warns Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government. 

**Advisers under Johnson's thumb**

How the two of them proceed concretely can be explained well by the ""Spads"": In order to govern, ministers need confidants who provide them with support and ensure that political ideas are formulated and implemented in the ministries. Since the reign of Tony Blair over 20 years ago, ministers have been selecting special advisors (spads) for this purpose, i.e. advisors they can rely on. That has now changed. Spads can practically only be appointed with the approval of Cummings. That was one reason why Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer in February in protest. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, accepted the new procedure. But in essence, it means that the ministers' advisors are now under the thumb of Johnson and Cummings, reporting to them, and the ministers can trust them less.

There have been similar changes in the communication of government policy: Johnson admittedly pretends that the press conferences the government holds create transparency. But the opposite is the case. The ministries' communications departments are now subordinate to a communications centre in the Cabinet Office, from where they take over the language arrangements. The ministers themselves have lost power over how their own policies are formulated and explained to the public. They are now only Johnson's mouthpiece. 

**Centralisation behind the scenes**

The treatment of civil servants as state secretaries has also changed. These ""Permanent Secretaries"" are high-ranking civil servants who are actually accountable to Parliament and are supposed to provide independent, expert advice to the government. These posts are now increasingly filled politically. Mark Sedwill, for example, used to be a senior civil servant and - because of his experience in military matters - also a security advisor to the government. He has now been urged to resign. Allegedly because the civil service had failed during the pandemic. But Sedwill had also officially spoken out against a No Deal Brexit. Now Johnson replaced him with a political follower, Special Advisor David Frost. He is already leading the Brexit negotiations for Great Britain and has not even been accountable to Parliament as an advisor. The fact that Frost has no expertise in security matters is irrelevant.

The centralization behind the scenes is so technical that the public hardly notices it. For example, on the last day before Parliament's summer recess, it was announced that, with immediate effect, large parts of the state data supervision will be transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the Cabinet Office. Cummings is sitting there. He uses the evaluation of data for electioneering, just as he did for the Brexit referendum in 2016. 

The restructuring of the government apparatus, i.e. the executive branch, is not the end of the story. The legislature, that is, the parliament, is also being undermined. The suspension of parliament by Johnson last summer is still fresh in the public mind. But it is hardly noticeable that ministers and Johnson himself repeatedly fail to give account to parliamentary committees. The fact that Johnson even tries to interfere in the composition of parliamentary committees and the election of their chairmen only caused a scandal when it came to the parliamentary security committee. 

The latter wanted to publish the Russia Report, which criticised the government for never having examined how much influence Moscow had exerted in elections and the Brexit referendum. Johnson had blocked the report for nine months and was now trying to appoint the chairman of the Security Committee. But that is not a matter for the government but for the parliamentary members of the committee. Tory Julian Lewis, who is well versed in security matters, slipped Johnson into the parade, had himself elected chairman with the help of the Labour representatives and published the report a week later. The result: Johnson immediately threw Lewis out of the group, as he had already done with his opponents over Brexit last year.  

**Get the jugdes sorted**

Johnson's going after the judiciary, too. He has not forgotten that the Supreme Court ruled that his suspension of parliament last year was unconstitutional. Now he wants to reform the body that appoints the judges of the Supreme Court and he wants to determine the framework within which the courts may pass judgement. Allegedly, the government must prevent the courts from enforcing ""politics by other means"". In reality, it was the Court of Justice that ensured with its rulings that parliament was not ignored by the government, that the government could not simply push through everything it wanted. Johnson wants to weaken the judiciary and deprive the public - and members of parliament - of the opportunity to defend themselves against his autocratic style of government.

That is the conclusion after one year of Johnson's government: outwardly tough slogans. In the background, a systematic centralisation of power, in order to be able to steer more and more and be less and less accountable. This year has changed British democracy. It has undermined it.

Reddit,"An appeal of peace to everyone upon the planet. Starting with you.. So I've taken an initiative to go all around the various country-based subreddits across Reddit to present this highly important message of peace. It's a bit long to read, but trust me, it is worth every moment of your time.

Here's the thing. There's this whole ""division"" mindset playing itself out in the world right now. It divides people into groups of two. One is ""us"" - the good guys. Other is ""them"" - the bad guys. And the battle you are expected to become a part of is an ""us vs them"" battle. It manifests itself as ""Right vs Left"". ""Liberal vs Conservative"". ""Insiders vs Outsiders"". Natives vs Immigrants. This race vs that race. This religion vs that religion. This political party vs that political party. This gender vs that gender. Capitalism vs Communism vs Socialism vs what-have-you-ism. This goes on and on and on.  

Every single day, we are being divided along the lines of *intense hatred* because the narrative being told to us is that ""they"" are the ""bad people"" --- and so ""we"" the ""good people"" must fight them by ***any*** **means necessary** to bring ""good to this world"" again. **And to achieve this so called ""good"", we are ready to riot, rage, diss/shame/insult each other on the internet or even MAIM/KILL OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. Other human beings that include ordinary, innocent, kind-hearted people like you and me. People with a mother waiting for them at their home. People with a son and a wife and a daughter waiting for them at their home. People with a grandma, a pet, or a newborn baby waiting for them at their home.** People with dreams. People with hopes. **People who have *so much* to offer the world in terms of kindness and service and assistance and ideas and inventions and innovations for a better future.** And for what? Because we have a minor disagreement over how the world can become a better place? Like, are we so lacking in intelligence, imagination, creativity and UNDERSTANDING that we simply cannot find better ways to resolve this? **Think about it.**  

Look at what's happening in a place like the US. There are two sides being presented as ""choices""; and both sides are filled with people who ultimately want good for their country. This includes some of the most toxic people from the said two sides -- if you were to go deep down into their psyche, you'll see that all they want to achieve is some kind of good, but that their ways of achieving the said things are way misaligned and out of balance/sanity. But yes, just because some toxic brainwashing has consumed them, does not mean that they are 100% evil. NOBODY is 100% evil - there's almost always a backstory to that that *we* do not know about. And yet, these two sides have been continuously fighting an all out war against each other, full of hate, vile stuff and whatnot, because each of them has been conditioned with the idea that **""those guys are the evil ones"".** Can you not see how ridiculous that is? **And this isn't just a problem with the US. It's everywhere in some form or the other, your country and my country included.**  

#So we need to get the hell out of our comfort zones and stop making this foolish hate-war and division-game a thing, before it is too darned late. Because if you don't, you will have blood on your hands simply for the virtue of never having as much as *attempted* to change things.  

I'm doing my part by posting this to Reddit in what is a large sub representative of a country. You can do your part by making this a part of your casual conversations with other people. *Everyone* can do their part in this simply by becoming a little more mindful whenever an ""us vs them"" argument is presented. Or simply by PAUSING AND THINKING before reacting in a toxic/hateful manner towards the ""other"" group. Try seeing the world from *their* perspective too before you hate/judge them. What if they too have some good points, and what if (gasps), they too only want GOOD like you yourself ultimately? **And please don't give me the cynical speeches that *one* man's efforts cannot change the world. Or that you're too ""self-conscious"" during conversations to bring this up or too ""introverted"" to say it or whatever. ONCE YOUR CHANCE IS GONE AND THERE IS BLOODSHED IN THIS WORLD BECAUSE YOU NEVER EVEN BOTHERED TO *TRY* CHANGING THINGS FOR WHATEVER REASON, NO REBOUND REGRETS OF YOURS ARE GOING TO BRING BACK THE DEAD OR RESTORE BROKEN LIVES AGAIN.** So yeah, PLEASE, at least make an attempt *where you can* if not anything else; even if it means having a random conversation with your dad or mom or sibling. The same way that I'm doing here via Reddit, and I'm a friend-less introvert myself. **Every little attempt makes a difference.**  

**Where there is a will, there is a way; and that one candle can (and does) light up a billion others eventually, *so what* if the process takes a little bit of time? Please take this appeal seriously, our fate of the world depends upon your action. And I'm not exaggerating --- just take a look at what's going on in the world around you.**  

Thank you for reading and my greatest apologies for using ALL CAPS in that one place. It is not *at all* my intention to shout at anyone, insult anyone or be preachy or anything.

initiative to go all around the various countrybased subreddits across reddit to present this highly important message of peace its a bit long to read but trust me it is worth every moment of your time heres the thing theres this whole division mindset playing itself out in the world right now it divides people into groups of two one is us the good guys other is them the bad guys and the battle you are expected to become a part of is an us vs them battle it manifests itself as right vs left liberal vs conservative insiders vs outsiders natives vs immigrants this race vs that race this religion vs that religion this political party vs that political party this gender vs that gender capitalism vs communism vs socialism vs whathaveyouism this goes on and on and on every single day we are being divided along the lines of intense hatred because the narrative being told to us is that they are the bad people and so we the good people must fight them by any means necessary to bring good to this world again and to achieve this so called good we are ready to riot rage dissshameinsult each other on the internet or even maimkill other human beings other human beings that include ordinary innocent kindhearted people like you and me people with a mother waiting for them at their home people with a son and a wife and a daughter waiting for them at their home people with a grandma a pet or a newborn baby waiting for them at their home people with dreams people with hopes people who have so much to offer the world in terms of kindness and service and assistance and ideas and inventions and innovations for a better future and for what because we have a minor disagreement over how the world can become a better place like are we so lacking in intelligence imagination creativity and understanding that we simply cannot find better ways to resolve this think about it look at whats happening in a place like the us there are two sides being presented as choices and both sides are filled with people who ultimately want good for their country this includes some of the most toxic people from the said two sides if you were to go deep down into their psyche youll see that all they want to achieve is some kind of good but that their ways of achieving the said things are way misaligned and out of balancesanity but yes just because some toxic brainwashing has consumed them does not mean that they are evil nobody is evil theres almost always a backstory to that that we do not know about and yet these two sides have been continuously fighting an all out war against each other full of hate vile stuff and whatnot because each of them has been conditioned with the idea that those guys are the evil ones can you not see how ridiculous that is and this isnt just a problem with the us its everywhere in some form or the other your country and my country included so we need to get the hell out of our comfort zones and stop making this foolish hatewar and divisiongame a thing before it is too darned late because if you dont you will have blood on your hands simply for the virtue of never having as much as attempted to change things im doing my part by posting this to reddit in what is a large sub representative of a country you can do your part by making this a part of your casual conversations with other people everyone can do their part in this simply by becoming a little more mindful whenever an us vs them argument is presented or simply by pausing and thinking before reacting in a toxichateful manner towards the other group try seeing the world from their perspective too before you hatejudge them what if they too have some good points and what if gasps they too only want good like you yourself ultimately and please dont give me the cynical speeches that one mans efforts cannot change the world or that youre too selfconscious during conversations to bring this up or too introverted to say it or whatever once your chance is gone and there is bloodshed in this world because you never even bothered to try changing things for whatever reason no rebound regrets of yours are going to bring back the dead or restore broken lives

Has it always been like this? Why is it the case? 
Having been following events in Syria/Ukraine for the past few years I can see there is clearly an agenda on both sides that is now reaching it's pinnacle in Syria.

Do you hate all Russians? Are they inherently evil or 'scum' thus the way we treat them?

Reddit,"Smoke alarms/CO detectors. So here's my feeble attempt at doing some good in the aftermath of a tragedy. As recent events have shown fire safety is no joke. Even in conventional houses that aren’t 24 floors high there are everyday risks that can be mitigated against.

Your local fire brigade has provisions to give out free smoke alarms to houses that don’t have working ones. If you go to their website they will have a section about “community safety”/ “home fire safety” or wording along those lines. Here is the page for London: 

http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/FireSafety.asp

Here you can book home fire safety visits and get smoke alarms fitted free of charge. I can't speak for every UK fire service, but the one I used to work for handed out loads of fire safety equipment such as safer extension leads, fireproof bedding and blankets for smokers, even deep fat fryers* if you traded in a chip pan. 

Another similarly preventable danger is carbon monoxide poisoning. Most fire brigades don't give out CO detectors for free, but you can buy one like this one

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fireangel-CO-9B-Basic-Carbon-Monoxide/dp/B00503T72E/ref=zg_bs_1939547031_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WEQWEVAWETXKV4072J5B

from Amazon for £13.10 plus delivery. It is well worth the money for the peace of mind alone. Buy loads and give them out as presents. Test both your smoke alarm and CO alarm regularly. 

The things mentioned above are incredibly little effort but could literally save your life. Cheers for reading, I hope that one of you reading this finds it useful.

Stay safe.


*these were terrible cheap ones that only made a tiny portion of chips. Honestly just buy some from a chip shop or get oven chips instead.

Reddit,"Brexit negotiations - It is impossible without pain [article about May visit to Bruessels last Monday]. [Original in german here.](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/brexit-verhandlungen-ohne-qualen-geht-es-nicht-15257859-p3.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2)

[This is from the same journalist that wrote an account of the disastrous Brexit dinner a few months ago.]

Half a year ago, Theresa May was at the height of her powers. She had opted for the ""hard Brexit"", praised ""global Britain"", initiated the withdrawal from the European Union and even called for new elections. May wanted more power. When Jean-Claude Juncker sat at her table in Downing Street and poured water into the wine, she went deaf. No bad news, please! She lives in a different galaxy, the President of the Commission rained afterwards.

Earlier this week May and Juncker met again for dinner, this time in Brussels. But now everything was completely different. May didn't trumpet, she pleaded for help. She talked about the risks she had taken when she had recently given up the hard Brexit course and asked for a transitional period of two years in which everything should remain the same. She recalled that she had also moved on the sensitive issue of finance. And she let it be known that her friends and foes are sitting at home, waiting to overthrow her. She has no room for maneuver, May said, the Europeans must create it for her.

Theresa May appeared anxious, despondent and discouraged to the President of the Commission. A woman who hardly trusts anyone, but is not ready for a liberation strike either. May's facial expressions and her appearance spoke volumes. This is how Juncker later described it to his colleagues. Anyone can see that: the Prime Minister is marked by the struggle with her own party. She wears deep rings under her eyes. She looks like someone who can't sleep for nights. You rarely see them laughing, of course, it is necessary for the photographers. But it [the laughter] appears tormented. In the past, May could literally throw herself out laughing, her whole body vibrating. Now she's putting up the utmost strength to keep her composure.

At the last minute, May had asked Juncker for an appointment. Prior to that, she spoke on the phone with Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron. Charm offensive is what they call it, but it doesn't fit here. They were cries for help. May knew that the Heads of State and Government were not prepared to confirm ""sufficient progress"" in the negotiations at the end of the week. This blocked the road to the second phase of the negotiations on the future. The Prime Minister wanted to pave at least one path: could the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier not be given a mandate to talk about the transition period following her request for it?

EU wants to talk about money

This would have been an important success for May. It would have watered down the rigorous negotiation plan. And it could have reassured the island's business community. Because they become more nervous with every day a chaotic, unregulated exit approaches. Several banks have already begun to execute their contingency plans, renting offices in Frankfurt or Paris, relocating business units. Others are getting ready. In the economy, no one can rely on hopes or wishes. And as a rule of thumb, jobs and production sites that are gone for the time being do not return. It's not worth moving twice.

The Europeans are only too aware of the British people's needs - they are their biggest leverage in the negotiations. That's why Merkel, Macron and Juncker couldn't be softened. All three insisted on further progress, especially on the sensitive issue of money, before there could be direct talks on the future. The [german] chancellor's office says dryly that none did not want the Brexit and could not solve the problems of the British for them. In Paris and Brussels, May heard nothing else. The Europeans had coordinated.
Nevertheless, however, it was not and should not look as if they were turning down the Prime Minister. Merkel, Macron and Juncker know exactly how fragile their situation is. At the same time, they recognize that May no longer has any illusions about the effects of the Brexit. Her initial threat that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" is no longer a factor in the negotiations. Macron has publicly pointed this out, and this is confirmed in Berlin. With her Florentine speech, May has already taken a different course. She admitted how bad it would be for the British economy if the country were to be catapulted out of the internal market from one day to the next. Boris Johnson, you foreign minister, is completely different: he still tells people that they are enjoying a ""great future"", even without a deal. It's better to negotiate with a realistic May than with the dreamer Johnson, that's how the calculation on the continent works. That's why her defeat at least had to be nicely wrapped up.


Pictures of the day are deceiving

Juncker said goodbye to her after dinner and he can do it like no other. The joint communiqué spoke of a ""constructive and friendly atmosphere"". Yes, the efforts should even be ""accelerated"". May's people were able to sell this to their media for half a day - until chief negotiator Barnier soberly pointed out that it always took two to accelerate.

When the [german] Chancellor arrived at the European Council on Thursday, she also said a few friendly sentences. Progress in the negotiations is not yet ""sufficient"", but ""encouraging to continue the work and to reach the start of the second phase in December"". Merkel and Macron went to the conference hall together afterwards - May in their midst. You could see the three of them in the animated conversation, these were the pictures of the day. One could not see that they were not even talking about the Brexit, but about the nuclear agreement with Iran.

May's last-minute diplomacy did not change the political conclusions of the Brexit negotiations. These had already been agreed between the EU ambassadors a week before the summit. The Governments and the Barnier team will therefore begin ""internal preparatory consultations"" on future relations with London and a transitional phase. This is a positive response to May's Florentine speech. Negotiating circles explain that without such a preparation it would not be possible to enter the second phase anyway. After all, guidelines must be drawn up again. The negotiators are confident that their papers will be leaked, and they have already priced it in: they are not talking directly to London, but the British government will find out the exact position of their partners.

Significant progress has so far been made in divorce negotiations only in the rights of the four million citizens who will be directly affected by the withdrawal - because they will then live on the ""other"" side. Eighty percent of London has already covered eighty percent of the way, they say internally. The biggest issue is likely to be resolved in the next few weeks: the British negotiators are now open to the European Court of Justice's arbitration after the Brexit.

Finances were taboo

The issue of Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is proving to be extremely complicated. While both sides agree that there should not be a ""hard land border"" on the island of Ireland, they have very different solutions in mind. The choice of path depends on future relations. Therefore, in spite of all the difficulties, Northern Ireland is not standing in the way of a transition to the second phase of the negotiations.

The real obstacle is money. The remaining 27 states require the United Kingdom to recognise all financial commitments it has entered into as a member. According to calculations by the EU Commission, this amounts to a good sixty billion net. The Council, as an institution of the Member States, has reached ninety billion euros. The difference is related to other items and cost estimates. Somewhere between the two numbers lies the zone in which London must end up.

At first, the British Government did not even want to take off. Finances were taboo. Then May made two decisions in Florence. On the one hand, she promised that her country would continue to pay into the EU budget until the end of 2020, i. e. even after leaving the EU in March 2019, which corresponds to a good twenty billion euros net. Curiously enough, it was the weakest position in the Europeans' exit account. This amount was promised only in the context of medium-term financial planning, but not by budget decision. However, May is likely to follow a tactical approach. Politically, it is the easiest way to sell this sum. If their country were allowed to stay in the internal market for another two years after the brexit, it would have to pay for it anyway.

Secondly, in Florence, May said a simple sentence:""The United Kingdom will recognise the commitments we made during the membership phase"", and that was a good thing from the point of view of the Europeans. But what does it mean exactly? What obligations? From the EU's point of view, it is in any case a matter of unpaid invoices (31 billion euros), future pension costs (9 billion euros), special funds (4 billion euros) and the assumption of liability risks. No one is asking London to give concrete figures now. The bill would only come to the withdrawal and could be broken down over a long period of time. However, he said, May had to commit herself to the individual positions.

The clock is ticking

She's recoiled before that. Of course, the Brexit hardliners would moan out loud in the Tories and in the media - they wanted to leave the European Union precisely because of the British net contributions. Johnson, perhaps Brexit minister David Davis could then also take a lethal strike. Nevertheless, Europe's politicians do not want to give in at this point. Berlin and Paris cannot do it at all, because as the largest net contributors, they themselves were left sitting on the costs. It would be a super bail-out for Britain.

The clock is ticking, chief negotiator Barnier reminds us of it on every occasion. The next EU summit will take place in mid-December. In Brussels, a man with great political experience formulates the challenge for the next few weeks in this way: May has to explain to her people why the cost of a chaotic Brexit is much higher than Brussels' bill. And how will that work? From now on, every bad news about Brexit is good news for May, the man says. The darker the prospects are, the sooner she can open her wallet.

From that point of view, it may not have been such a bad week for the Prime Minister. Their Ministry of Finance reported a record inflation rate of three percent - prices are rising. A research institute calculated that ordinary families would have 300 euros less to spend a year if customs duties were due again in trade with the continent. And the OECD, the Club of Industrialised Countries, recommended that the Brexit should be cancelled altogether, or at least that it should strive for a ""close"" relationship with the EU.",2017-10-22

# ***The day after***

What happens if the Brits really are voting to leave the EU on the 23th of June? Politicians, analysts and officials already made their plans.

## **24th of June 2016, 7 am, United Kingdom**

After waking up today the Britons live in a different country.
Counting the votes took the whole night, at around 2am the first results came in, sometimes the Pro-Brexit voters were in the lead, sometimes the Pro-Stay voters.

Now, just in time for breakfast, while the citizens drink their first cup of tea, the info graphics on TV show a divided nation. City versus countryside. Young versus old. Educated versus uneducated. On the maps the cities are blue (stay) and the surrounding areas red (leave). Englands North-East is a red block, Scotland is blue.

But there is no doubt: With a very thin margin the UK voted for the Brexit.

Journalists are reporting about spontaneous street parties, where people with glancing eyes talk about how the UK is free now.
Politicians, bankers, lawyers, journalists in all of the EU are on their phones. The European community is facing the largest crisis in its history.

## **24th of June, 8:30am, Berlin, Bundeskanzleramt** (Chancellery)

On the 7th floor of the chancellery, with a great view over the Tiergarten, Angela Merkel has surrounded herself with her closest counsellors. Foreign politics advisor Christoph Heusgen, Head of the EU department Uwe Corsepius, government spokesman Steffen Seibert and Beate Bauman, chief of staff. For hours, Merkel talked with Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the minister of foreign affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the French president François Hollande and President of the EU Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.

""*We are in blind flight now.*"" says a high ranking official.

Of course there were secret meetings in the past weeks, small circles, in which the potential effects of a Brexit were discussed. The foreign ministers of the six ECC founding members met two times. They will meet again this afternoon, in Berlin, as a show of unity. But nobody has a detailed Plan B. There are too many unknowns for that: How will the markets react? What will Cameron do? How quickly do the Brexit supporters want to get out of the EU?

They have to be fast now. No shock, no uncoordinated babbling. The EU needs to show unity and capability of acting. The official tone is agreed on quickly: We regret the decision of the British people, but we respect it. The EU is strong and united.

But that is only the language for the press conferences, for the evening news. The truth is more complicated.

The question is: What should we say? Equally important: Who says it, and where, in which format? Ideally all 27 EU member states, without the UK. But can it be organized fast enough? The national interests are differing: Poland and Hungary could show sympathy for the exit.

So instead, just a smaller group? Just the six ECC founding members? But how would Eastern Europe react? Merkel doesn't want to meet the press alone, at least together with Hollande. But where? In Paris? Berlin? Brussels?

Nuances matter in this situation. Tone, and symbols. Only one thing stands: Nothing that Merkel says today can express the size of the shock.

In the midst of the consultations a call from London interrupts. It's Cameron, the beaten Prime Minister. We want to talk to Merkel. She takes the phone, walks towards the giant window in her office: ""David?""

## **24th of June, 8am, city of London, Paternoster Square, London Stock Exchange**

Just like every day, the London stock exchange opens on time at 8am. On the large sculpture of light in the atrium the market data starts to run. It all points in one direction, downwards. The British pound is down 20%.

A few blocks further, in the Threadneedle Street, in the British central bank, president Mark Carney opens his safe. Therein lies the plan in case of a Brexit. More than a year a task force worked on it, under the name ""Project Bookend"". Now its time has come. The central bank goes into crisis mode.

The Bank of England assumes that following the Brexit, there will be a setback in economic growth. Companies will invest less, consumer will consume less. The economy could shrink up to 6%, up to 800,000 jobs are in immediate danger, the bankers think.

Carney knows that he cannot save the jobs. But he can stop chaos at the financial markets. That is why he supplied the British banks with money before the decision fell, and now he opens the gates again.

## **24th of June, 9:20am, Berlin, Government district**

Background interview of a top German official with a British economics journalist.        

""*Of course we hope that the price the UK has to pay because of the uncertainty of the financial markets will be massive, so that it deters all other members from leaving. That would be the preferred result of this*""

""*Klaus, do you want to say that if the markets crash in London that is good for the EU?*""

""*You cannot quote me with that, John, but that's how it is. Hopefully the populists in the other countries finally notice that leaving the EU comes with a price. A high price.*""

## **24th of June, 11am, 10 Downing Street**

Daving Cameron opens the black door of his house in Downing Street. The world press is awaiting him. Cameron has to say what he never wanted to say. He has to explain something, that he doesn't understand. He steps to the wooden console he stood behind so often in the last years. The shadows below his eyes are telling that the didn't sleep much this night. ""*The British people have spoken, and I respect its votum: The UK has decided to leave*"".

Cameron knows that this is a historic moment. Probably the only moment people will remember of his tenure in office: The end of the UK in the EU. Cameron straightens up his back. ""*I was struggling, whether I can continue to be Prime Minister*"" he says, and takes a deep breath. ""*I think that someone who believes in this decision can do a better job at implementing it*"".

Cameron says some more sentences about the British democracy and the friendship with Europe. He promises to continue in his office, until a successor is determined. Then he disappears behind the black door. He is out.

Breaking news around the world. The hashtag #exitcameron explodes on Twitter. Commentators around the world immediately ask: Who will be the next prime minister? Boris Johnson, former mayor of London and leader of the Brexit supporters? Theresa May, former minister of the interior? Or minister of finance George Osborne, Camerons crown prince?

## **24th of June, 12am, Brussel, Press room of the EU commission**

Jean-Claude Juncker cannot hide his disappointment. Pale he steps in front of the journalists, stony-faced. He stayed in his office this night, just now drank a coffee in the bistro, alone. He feared this moment, but, like most people in Brussels, he didn't believe in it until the last moment.  Juncker starts his speech in English, then switches to French. Even this is a signal today.

""*A majority of the British voters has decided to leave the European Union. I respect that decision, even though I think it is the wrong one.*""

The window-less press room in the basement of the office of the commission has the charme of a bunker. It is filled with people, the air is gone. ""*When will the negotiations with the UK start*?"" asks a journalist. And: ""*Will the kingdom have access to the common market?*"" Juncker waited for those questions. ""*The United Kingdom will not be accepted with open arms again.*"" he says in a strict tone and points to article 50 of the EU treaty. The article handles the leaving of a member, just five short paragraphs, never intended to be used.

First, the British government has to officially talk to each member state that they want to leave the EU. Just afterwards negotiations can start. And: ""*Out means out. To leave the EU means to leave the common market*"".

## **24th of June, 2pm, Bethmannstraße 3, Frankfurt am Main, City administration**

Markus Frank ordered his bread rolls into his office today, but couldn't start eating yet. Since this morning he was on the phone constantly. Talking to bankers, lawyers, consulting companies from London, which are thinking about moving to Frankfurt. Frank never was a Brexit supporter. But he knows that there lies a giant change for his city. The city is the first choice of many banks now that London has left the EU.

According to a study of Martin Hellmich, professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance, around 20,000 bankers could move to Frankfurt. Markus Frank already ordered to calculate how much office space there is, short-term - around 1.2 million square meters. Enough for some newcomers.

## **24th of June, 5pm, Nanterre near Paris, 76 Rue des Suisses**

At the party office of the radical right Front National in the Paris suburb the party leaders come together. There is just one topic, the effects of the Brexit for France. To be more precise: for the Front National. The economic advisor of the party leader, Phillippe Murer, and the chief of the election campaign, Michel Guiniot are there. Both immediately fight about whether the party should call for France leaving the EU, too - a Frexit?

Murer is wary that they could look like copy-cats. Guiniot argues against that. He is seeing the main topic of the upcoming presidential elections next year. ""The brexit was a thunder strike. This is about national sovereignty and independence, our key demands!"". At 7pm Marine Le Pen is driven to Boulogne-Billancourt, the studios of the Tv channel TF1. In the main evening news at 8pm the brexit is the main topic. The Élysée-palace announces a statement of president Hollande, who regrets the exit of the Brits, while announcing a even closer collaboration with Berlin. At 8:10pm Ĺe Pen has two minutes of air time, live.

""*The Brexit is a symbol for the recovered independence of the peoples of Europe*"" she says, ""*a victory above the ruling system. It shows that the EU isn't a prison you can't escape from. The French too will find the courage to free themselves!*""

## **26th of June, 2pm, Brussels, Office of the commission**

For the first time since the Brexit the EU commission is meeting, on a Sunday. That wasn't the case for ages. Jean-Claude Juncker still looks pale, but at least he tries some of his infamous jokes. Over the weekend everyone babbled away, politicians, political scientists, commentators. No sign of the proclaimed unity of Europe.

One of the first who talked was the former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt. The goodbye of the Brits is sad, but also a chance: ""*Only with a real political union, Europe has a future*"". Economical and currency union have to be deepened as fast as possible.

More Europe as an answer to Euroscepticism? The president of the European Council, the Pole Donald Tusk, immediately pushes back: ""*The EU cannot give the impression that we didn't get the message.*""

Juncker doesn't want to comment on that. He calls for pragmatism: ""*We have to work, work, work!*"" he proclaims to his colleges.

Thousand of legal bindings have to be unwoven, the financial commitments between the EU and the UK have to be calculated apart. Countless questions are open: How will the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - a EU outer border in the future - be controlled? In which seas can British fishers fish? And will Brits needs a Visa to visit EU-counties?

Juncker calls for fair negotiations. One cannot, he says, put ""*artificial costs*"" on the UK. That means: London shouldn't be punished. That would just incite further resentments against the EU. Nobody in the circle of the 28 commissioners is saying it, but that is the biggest fear in the room: That others will follow. That a wave of exits starts.

Without the UK the EU will continue, somehow. But without France?

## **27th of June, 11:30am, Sintra, Portugal, Hotel Penha Longa**

When he is on the road, Vitor Constâncio always carries his cryptophone with him. The Portuguese is in the directorate of the European Central Bank and responsible for the markets not losing their mind if something on the planet goes wrong. Like right now. In that case he is ready to suppress the panic with cheap money.

This Monday Constâncio is in Sintra, a small city near Lisbon. The ECB is hosting a conference with bankers and economists from all over the world. While he is entertaining his guests, Constâncio is constantly updated by his people in Frankfurt about the state of the financial markets.

They have good news. The slight upwards trend of Friday seems to continue. The markets in Asia are stable. The reaction of the British central bank seems to have worker.

Constâncio puts his phone away. He looks over the beautiful landscape around the luxury hotel. What really worries him isn't the short-term reactions, but the long-term: The fear that following the British exit other countries will follow - and that investors see that possibility and pull their money out of Europe, because they fear the collapse of the currency union. Then it isn't about falling stock prices anymore, but a world wide economic crisis.

## **28th of June, Brussels, EU Council**

It looks like a usual EU meeting: Limos arriving, doors are opened, head of states and governments are leaving the cars. They hurry along the cameras and microphones, some of them stop. Angela Merkel stops, too. She is the master of not showing excitement. ""*Of course the situation is serious*"", she says, ""*but we have to wait what the British prime minister will say*"". A short nod, a smile, and she disappears in the building.

Over the weekend, Merkel was in Paris, she spoke to the French president, the Italian prime minister attended, too. They discussed to have a special EU meeting, but the situation was dire enough already. Better display routine. The meeting on Tuesday was still standing.

As one of the last ones, David Cameron enters the building. It is his last appearance in front of the head of governments. Dead man walking. Even before the meeting starts Cameron states that he won't request the leaving of the UK today. He will leave that to his successor.

In the meeting room on the fifth floor, Cameron gets a reserved greeting. Just the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban is shaking his hand strongly. Cameron sits next to Malta and Estonia, near the president of the EU council. He doesn't talk.

Until deep in the night the effects of the Brexit are discussed. Just in the early morning hours other questions follow: the situation in Greece. Sanctions against Russia. Refugee crisis. The world doesn't stand still just because the UK leaves.

## **7th of June, Edinburgh, Bute House, Seat of the Scottish Prime Minister**

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Prime Minister, doesn't get loud often. Just when she has to.

Since the 24th of June, her predecessor Alex Salmond is increasingly pushing for a second Scottish Referendum of Independence. If the English are leading the Scots out of the EU then Scotland has to leave the UK, to continue to belong to Europe.

Soland dreams of a independent Scotland, of a new national border, roughly along the Hadrian's Wall. The Queen would have to cross if if she would want to visit her summer residence in Balmoral. But would she even be the Queen of Scotland?

Nicola Sturgeon wants to lead her country into indepence, too. That is what she told Salmond on the phone, very clearly. But she only wants a second referendum if there is a majority for an exit. At the moment polls show that just 39% of Scots want independence now. For a good reason: An independent Scotland would have a giant whole in its balance. Until now London is paying.

""*Do you want to ruin the country to get your will?*"" Sturgeon yells into her phone. But maybe Salmond had already hang up there.

## **20th of October, 5pm, Brussels, EU Council**

Three months have passed since the referendum. The UK still is a member of the EU, the British embassy to the EU even increased its staff from 120 to nearly 200, to negotiate the exit.

For todays meeting the new prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson is excepted in Brussel. Just after the summer break he was nominated by the conservatives next to Theresa May, then they elected him.

Johnson doesn't waste time with amenities. Formally he announces his request to his colleges, that the United Kingdom wants to leave the Union. The exit mechanism is started. Some of the attendees of the meeting think they have notices a small jitter in Johnsons voice.

## **30th of October, 11am, Birmingham, Congress centre**

It is a cold day in October when Boris Johnson enters the great hall of the Congress Centre. The Tories came together for the first party convention since Johnson became prime minister.

The new premier steps to the console, his blond hair scrubby as always. He nods to a man with side parting and glasses in the first row - it's Michael Gove, who lead the Exit campaign together with Johnson. He used to be minister of justice, now he is the head of the new ministry of Brexit.

""*Welcome to freedom!*"" Johnson proclaims. ""*Welcome to sovereignty!*""

Even though Johnson appears to be happy, he is annoyed by the Europe-topic. He doesn't have patience for technical details, to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU. How high were the EUs customs on imports again? And it is really true that Norway pays nearly as much for access to the common market as an EU member?

Johnsons looks over the crows. Multiple of his predecessors stumbled over the Europe question. That won't happen to him. He wants to reinvent the UK, just like the reinvented London.

He clenches his fist. ""*The UK*"" he calls ""*will leave the EU, but not Europe!*"" He will ""*organise a separation between friends. A New Deal for Britain!*"".

That is the new slogan, created by marketing specialists: **A New Deal for Britain**. That sounds like upraise, like sovereignty, like future.

At least it sounds better than the news in the economic newspapers. They talk about high interest rates, about foreign companies stopping their investment, about rising unemployment and dooming recession.

On the way to the underground car park he asks his head of staff whether there is finally a visit of Merkel scheduled. She didn't show up in London yet.

## **30th of December, 9pm, The George and Dragon Pub, Downe, Kent**

The End of the year 2016 is celebrated by Nigel Farage, head of the British independence party (UKIP) in a pub. His wife sits next to him, a few party friends are there, too.

2016 has his year. The year of the exit. It became true, the thing he always pushed for. But Farage isn't happy. He talk to his followers: ""*We will make sure that Johnson doesn't take the mick out of us!*"".

On TV debates Farage now takes the role of the last revolutionary. He reminds everyone that Johnson promised on his campaign to enforce strict controls on immigrants. And to stop payment to Brussels. ""*And what has happened? Nothing!*""

Indeed the new government talks suspiciously often about the advantages of Europe. About the crises in the world that force Europe together. The payments to Brussel cannot be stopped either: Every country simply pays for access to the common market.

To Farage the new government sounds like the old one. He has the suspicion that Johnson want a kind of EU membership light. That he betrays the heritage of the Brexit-Revolution.

## **2nd of January 2017, Beijing, Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China**

The seven most powerful men of China came together around a table, and the most powerful of them, President Xi Jinping, rises to speak: ""*This Brexit, what a folly!*"". He shakes his head. ""*As if Europe isn't complicated enough already. As if they didn't have enough problems already. Crazy.*"" The six others nod in agreement. 

Then they turn toward the extension of the Pacific fleet again..

Reddit,"Life at the Thin Edge of the Wedge – The Grim Reality of the Independent Junior Criminal Bar. I was shown this article by a friend today. Like most people I cast a quick eye over an article, but within 30 seconds I was hooked. The myth about criminal barristers need exposing and the issue more recognition. The author is a criminal barrister who casts light on the gritty life as a barrister and why the proposed cuts to Legal Aid by the current Government would have a catastrophic effect on the English criminal legal system.

**Life at the Thin Edge of the Wedge – The Grim Reality of the Independent Junior Criminal Bar**


When asked what I do for a living, I often hesitate momentarily before changing the subject. Despite feeling immensely proud and privileged to have made it into the illustrious world of the purported legal ‘elite’, the words ‘criminal barrister’ do not roll off the tongue with the ease I’d expected such achievement would ultimately engender. You see, experience tells me that once a new acquaintance hears the ‘B’ word, their reaction will invariably range somewhere between curious disgust right up to the unfettered revulsion you might feel if you found out you’d just mistakenly cleaned your teeth with the old toothbrush reserved for scrubbing under the rim of the toilet…

Over the months, I have gleaned with an increasing sense of incredulity (mainly through the projection of typed vitriol from anonymous members of the public who have contributed to the various comments pages in the national press) that people don’t just dislike criminal barristers: they actively hate them. It would appear that such detestation stems from a single unqualified and hitherto unchallenged belief: that criminal barristers are contemptuously rich, upper-class, cash-leaching parasites, who take pleasure in feeding off the misery of an already-downtrodden society, by plundering a bottomless trough of public money in order to fund endless rounds of golf in the Caribbean; invariably with a bunch of cockroach-headed criminal barrister chums. I have come to the sad conclusion that far from being viewed as a respected, time-honored profession necessary for the protection of a safe and fair society; the general public currently ranks criminal barristers (and indeed solicitors) somewhere between paedophiles and pond algae on the food chain. It is no wonder that the recent ‘Reforming Legal Aid’ proposals (colloquially known as ‘Butchering Justice’ to those who work within the profession) have generated at best public apathy, and at worst, public support.

Whatever your television drama-inspired preconceptions about the elusive world of the Criminal Bar, I invite you to suspend your judgment for just a few minutes. This article seeks to shatter and correct the inaccurate ‘fat cat’ stereotype, which seeks to do the vast majority of my outstanding, hardworking colleagues a gross disservice. Whilst focused upon the plight of the junior Criminal Bar, most of what is written applies equally to criminal counsel and solicitors of all levels. The views and experiences are my own and they might offend. Hey ho.

Schizophrenia, 5am Trains and Chipmunks

Being a barrister is not a glamorous job. Each case is a random selection from a veritable smorgasbord of child rape, animal pornography, domestic violence and death. Each working day requires a strong stomach, a bottomless overdraft, a thick skin and the ability to survive on a petrol-station-food diet. Despite Maxine Peake’s convincing portrayal of the elegant Martha Costello QC in the popular ITV drama, Silk, the reality of life as a junior criminal barrister is nowhere near as alluring or straightforward. Whilst Martha, red lippy neatly applied, glides elegantly into court within walking distance of her chambers just before the case starts, I am often seen resembling a slightly deranged, irate scarecrow wrestling a large suitcase, part-read lever-arch file and unruly umbrella on a windy, rain-soaked railway platform at a time when most people are in deep REM sleep. With many a 4.30am start and 2am finish, I have neglected those I love and have thus so far foregone having children, buying a property or obtaining a pension in pursuit of my career. I have pondered the subject of untimely chipmunk death more than is healthy. I have cross-examined psychopaths, received death threats, been shouted at by judges and have lost so many hours of sleep that my family tell me I have aged ten years in less than three. There is something deliciously masochistic about being an independent criminal barrister: the unenviable pressures of work, you might think, could only be rewarded by a handsome remuneration. So, what do I do and what am I paid?

A Day in the Life…

Nothing can emotionally equip you for the day that you are sitting alone in a cell with someone accused of having sex with a child, having to go through graphic details of their alleged perversion. God forbid that you are required by the court to grade haunting child pornography pictures. I recall with a sense of nausea the day in which I prosecuted a solicitor-advocate who demanded that the court re-classify a photograph of an 8-year old girl shackled on her hands and knees to a bed, from a level five (bestiality and Sadomasochism) to a level four, as ‘the presence of a dog’s head near her genitals did not indicate that she would have gone on to be forced to engage in sexual relations with the animal’. As much as I wanted to walk out and be sick, as much as I wanted to clear my mind of this awful vision; my professional duties meant that I remained on my feet, wigged and gowned, appearing to be ever the unwavering professional to those baulking in the public gallery. I later went home and cried. Becoming a criminal barrister, I learned, does not make a person an emotional automaton. You just become incredibly adept at maintaining a poker face and a cool head. What would you have to be paid to view an ever-haunting image such as the one I have described? Could you forget it? I can’t.

It is worthy of note that I prosecuted the aforementioned case: my job is as much about looking after witnesses and victims as it is representing those accused of crimes. I frequently spend my lunch hours sitting in the witness suite, not being paid for such, explaining cases and procedure to those who have been burgled, attacked or sexually abused. I frequently sit with women who have been beaten by their partner for the twentieth time in front of their children, who wish to retract their statement but may be prosecuted themselves for doing so, in a bid to guide them through the law. Sadly, the press chooses to ignore such efforts, as ‘fat cat’ is much easier to type.

Further, unlike many other professions whereby it’s relatively easy to turn up each day and turn in a standard, often-rehearsed performance, being a criminal barrister means that most of your life is spent living on your nerves. No two days are the same: the criminal law is constantly changing and unlike civil practitioners whose cases are often decided on paper, the scrutiny of the public gallery, press and fellow practitioners is enough to give you cold sweats on a daily basis. The English Criminal Bar is revered the world over as a centre of excellence: simply put, any practitioner who is judged as less than outstanding would find it very difficult to be briefed, let alone be respected by colleagues and judges alike.

Being a junior criminal practitioner affords you no concessions: once you stand up to make your submissions, no judge, jury or journalist will look upon you with sympathetic consideration. If you forget to ask a crucial question, dry up or your interpretation of the law is woefully wrong, your chambers and instructing solicitor will hear about it on the grapevine before you even get back to the robing room to cry in the toilets. Being a self-employed, independent practitioner means that your learning is instinctive; through osmosis watching senior, more accomplished barristers as well as through rigorous ongoing self-learning. In the early days, self-esteem plummets to make way for superficial confidence necessary to do the job; before incremental benchmarks of competence are reached. I have found this to be a necessary process which serves to keep me switched on, focussed on excellence and grounded. But an easy process it is not: in the early days, I am not ashamed to say that the pressure and politics of pupillage, the unpredictability of travelling the length and breadth of the UK on cases received the night before and the stress of working 70 hours plus each week was enough to put me temporarily on anti-depressants.

Whilst my training and education took many years, costing tens of thousands of pounds; at no stage was I ever taught to recognise or deal with signs of Schizophrenia, personality disorders or other mental health problems; an increasingly common situation which besets me each week. I frequently sit in front of clients in conference rooms, who have self-harm injuries, a history of suicide attempts or drug and alcohol abuse problems. Bear in mind that unlike social workers or police officers, who have managers and co-workers with whom to discuss difficult cases, an independent criminal practitioner generally works alone, with only their sense of judgment for company. Reasoning with an agitated, unmedicated, violent Schizophrenic who has been locked in a cell overnight requires patience, understanding and unparalleled communication skills. To then stand up in court and articulate your case to a judge requires tenacity, adaptability and poise. Are these skills not important? Would they be more important if it were your son or daughter in the dock or witness suite?

Fortunately, the majority of criminal barristers whom I have been fortunate to encounter during my short career thus so far, are best described as well-spoken social workers in wigs, who care immensely about doing a truly outstanding job. To say that anyone can do this job would be to suggest that the average person is an indomitable, fearless, perfection-oriented workhorse who strives constantly to be better than they were yesterday, in the pursuit of justice and fairness: hardly ubiquitous characteristics in today’s disposable, convenience-obsessed world. It therefore offends me when it is suggested by those who have no idea what I do and for what financial reward; that my contribution is worth very little to society. You might be surprised to learn that what I earned last year couldn’t be construed as a ‘living wage’ – i.e. enough to sustain my already frugal standard of living. Whilst many in other professional roles or indeed civil barristers can easily make a few hundred quid from a few hours’ work, junior criminal practitioners are at the coal face of abuse, violence and neglect every day of their working lives, for a relative pittance.

We work incredibly long hours borne out of sheer personal passion, professional pride, the love of the struggle, and because the vast majority of us actually care about what we do. Contrary to popular misconception, criminal lawyers are not self-serving robots: we may have woefully failed on the public relations front; however this isn’t because we have nothing to say on the subject. We are simply too busy working 70-hour weeks on behalf of our clients and victims to have regard to correcting a misaligned stereotype largely perpetrated by lazy, selective and often downright inaccurate journalism designed to sell newspapers rather than educate the masses.

Many will not be persuaded that I am an ordinary working class woman with a lovely dinner-lady mum and a huge, ever-increasing overdraft. As people watch me sweep, raven-like through the court foyer in my billowing Batman-inspired fancy dress, I see the envious pounds signs reflected in people’s eyes, as I secretly worry whether I can afford to buy my instructing solicitor a vending machine coffee… So, let me tell you what I get in return for my efforts.

Reddit,"Upskilling Politically: How to Discussion. Looking for help/advice from the community. How do I educate myself on politics in today’s world to have a balanced view, does balanced even exist? I find it nearly impossible to come to a rational decision using evidence and not gut feelings or believing in it because your parents brought you up that way.

I am a 29 year old white male, work for the one of the Big 4, raised in the north working on market stalls as a teenager now working in artificial intelligence. 

Politics at the moment reminds me of discussions I’ve had with various people of different faiths, if you try have a discussion, opinions seem to fall over after a few questions, the discussion turns hostile and you get the back off, it’s my view and that’s that, without a ever really hearing any evidence to support said beliefs.

I would like to learn from other people how they approached ‘upskilling politically’ with the intention of improving my approach so I feel better informed for the next time we have to vote. 

My current approach

1. Most days read all the front pages courtesy of UK politics and the comments sections to see what people have to say!
2. Rotate news channels between BBC, ITV and Channel 4
3. Follow all parties on Twitter and Facebook (no sign on Instagram 🙏)
4. Read parts of the manifestos


Generally my political knowledge is weak, so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

**DAVID DAVIS: Just ignore bogus Chancellor Hammond… the sun is Brexing out**

*The Chancellor is attempting to frighten the ­population into imagining the most ­terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal*


> WHEN the world suffered enormous financial crisis in 2008, the Queen asked simply: “Why did no one see it coming?”

> Of course, she was right to ask.


> Chancellor Philip Hammond is predicting a dire economic outcome for Britain if Brussels negotiations result in a 'no deal' Brexit

Reddit,"UK's bright future ahead?. I made this comment in response to someone complaining about the status of UK. I see this being a quite prevalent opinion so I thought about making a proper post to showcase what is actually going on and to hear your opinion on the matter.

Disclaimer: My opinion is that UK has a bright future ahead in spite of Brexit not because of it. I personally think that with all the advantages UK would've been able to influence the EU much more from the inside and shape it into something great.

Anyway, here we go:

1. UK is expected to become one of the richest countries in europe in the coming years. [Go to 2028 and have a look](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) at gdp per capita.
2. [Taxes are some of the lowest in EU](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=AWCOMP) and will remain there because of the next point[(if you find it hard to read check this ss I took)](https://imgur.com/a/wLUS2Br)
3. Demographics are awful in most of europe compared to [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom). Just check that inverted pyramid in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany) or worse in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Italy)....
4. UK [still second place in soft-power ranking](https://brandfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GSPS-2024-Social-Media-Post.jpg) just behind the US.
5. UK [remains the tech/financial ""mecca""](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-helped-britain-keep-euro-clearing-london-brexit/) of europe despite what everyone was saying.
6. Housing. Yes London is expensive but a flat in Glasgow (a city of 1.8 million)  [is about 50k...](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/144632381#/?channel=RES_BUY) So if you work remote you can pay 300 for a mortgage after a 5k down payment.

Reddit,"Immigrants can no longer become Architects (UK Tier 2 Visa). The government have made it impossible for immigrants to be architects (after they’ve paid £120,000 on a UK education), by raising the minimum wage requirements for a skilled working visa to £38,700. This is a 50% rise and over £11,000 more than the starting salary for a graduating (Masters) Architecture student (£27,000).

I say this as an architecture student at a school where people are protesting the new visa policy. Preventing immigration is one thing, but actively removing skilled workers from the country because architects and other skilled workers aren’t paid enough is another thing entirely.  The government/home office should be held accountable for yet another absurdly cruel scheme to get votes for the next election.

Skilled immigrants contribute to the economy, pay high NHS fees, National Insurance, VISA fees, etc. 
Telling people who want to add to the economy to go home because it’s ‘Britain for the British’ and they want to ‘decrease immigration by 300,000’ is a shortsighted approach that harms the dwindling skilled labour sector and the economy. 

This isn’t even to mention the impact it’s having on separating families and British universities.

The government’s approach is reactionary in a desperate plea for votes, without any real plan or desire to improve the country. 

Once again, thank you to the Tories for continuing to make people’s lives just a little bit worse. 

-Clarification edit: 

1. The Graduate visa doesn’t give enough time to qualify as you need 24 months of PEDRs (e.g proof of experience in practice) before you can take your Part 3 exam which itself takes a year. 

2. I’m not an international student - I’m a UK citizen also training to be an Architect.

3. MArch and BArch are specifically designed for people to become Architects in the UK.

Positives:
- Potential for increased wages for domestic architects due to change in supply and demand, if there’s no outsourcing and Architecture firms charge more for projects.
- Reduced competition could lead to more job stability. 
- Reduction in overall architecture students and graduates would lead for more jobs available for local graduates.

Negatives:
- A talent pool reduction and could limit global competitiveness and drive larger firms elsewhere. 
- Increased project costs resulting from higher labour costs could lead to less building. 
- Deterring international students will hit universities hard, as they charge 3x more for international students.
- Slowdowns in construction, real estate, and urban planning.
- Reduction in talent pool could lead to a reduction in architectural quality.
- More architectural work might move abroad, reducing tax to the country, stagnating the industry and lead to a greater shortage of skilled workers.
- British architects may leave to work in larger international companies. 
- Skilled international students may start applying for Tier 3 Unskilled Visa jobs putting pressure on lower income workers.

Reddit,"Do we need to change how we view work?. Been thinking about this for a while, but specifically triggered by labour’s recent welfare cuts. Do we need to change how we view work? For a long time now work has been viewed as almost the purpose of existence in most parts of the world. People are defined by their job. The first question you often ask a new person is about their job. But increasingly many jobs are becoming redundant/ serve no real purpose. I’m sure lots of us are familiar with the concept of bullshit jobs and we know people who genuinely don’t seem to do anything of any value at all/ are wfh doing sfa. The advancement of AI is just going to compound this as many white collar jobs are streamlined/ taken over by a growth in AI. 

If AI is going to take jobs in this way we are going to need to share out wealth, we are going to need a welfare state so that everyone feels they have a stake in society and that it’s actually a good thing that AI gives us more time for leisure/ artistic endeavours/ travel. This could be a very exciting time as human beings finally get to enjoy centuries of progress and not have a life dictated by work, but politicians of almost every party still seem to view work as the point of everything, exemplified by Labour (ostensibly left wing) cuts to benefits. 

This obsession with not working/ being unemployed as a moral failure is going to have to shift in the next few decades and I don’t see anyone talking about it anywhere in the political mainstream. 
Apologies for my long old ramble, what are your guys thoughts?

EDIT: A lot of people are saying AI will just shift us into different fields of work to serve AI and in that case I have to ask what is the point of embracing AI as a technology if it doesn’t really make our lives better.

Reddit,"Kim Johnson (Liverpool Riverside MP) response to the Online Safety Act. I recently wrote to my local MP expressing concern regarding the online Safety Act. I specifically mentioned concerns regarding censorship and labour's policy of calling anyone who disagrees with it a supporter of sex offenders. 

I have received back the following response from Kim Johnson, which definitely reads as a copy paste party response and doesn't address my concerns regarding the name calling by labour.


""Thank you for getting in touch with your concerns about the Online Safety Act.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your views, particularly around issues as important as free speech and privacy, both of which I believe are fundamental to any healthy democracy.

I understand that many people have some level of scepticism surrounding this legislation and I do believe it is important that the Government and other key stakeholders continue to listen to these concerns so that this legislation is robust and most importantly is transparent.

The Online Safety Act was introduced with the stated aim of making the internet a safer space, especially for children and vulnerable users, by holding tech companies accountable for the harmful content on their platforms. We’ve all seen the very real damage that online abuse, grooming, and disinformation can do. Tackling those harms is not just sensible, it’s urgent.

However, I also share many of the concerns raised by campaigners, civil liberties groups, and legal experts around the risk of government overreach, the chilling effect on free expression, and the potential for mass surveillance or content takedowns without due process. We must never allow necessary protections to become a back door for censorship or intrusion into our private lives.

I have consistently called for digital regulation that is transparent, proportionate, and subject to robust scrutiny. That includes safeguards to ensure that measures intended to combat harm do not disproportionately silence dissenting voices, especially those from marginalised communities who already face barriers to speaking out.

I will continue to monitor how this legislation is implemented in practice and to press ministers on ensuring it upholds both online safety and our civil liberties. We need a digital environment that is both safe and free and those two principles should never be in conflict.

Thank you once again for contacting me regarding this issue.

Yours sincerely,

Reddit,"What happens after the welfare cuts?. I feel this has not been thought through properly. There are currently over 1.6 million people actively looking for work, and around 736,000 jobs available.

As it stands, there is very little reason for companies to hire people with disabilities. That is assuming employers are accommodating, and most are not. I do not receive PIP myself, but in my case I can have weeks where I have hospital appointments every other day. I can barely manage two days in the office, and my health is only getting worse. My company is somewhat understanding, as I am still able to deliver high quality work despite everything, but even then I am still mistreated, and I can tell it is reflecting badly on me.

However, my health was not this bad when I was hired. Had it been like this at the time, I would have had very few opportunities. The only real chances would have come from my previous experience, back when I was in much better health. Even then, interviews themselves are often biased against people with learning disabilities, and the increased use of AI is only making that worse.

Whats worse is wage wise people with disabilities are disadvantaged, what the government is doing will only throw people down, it's going to hurt alot of people, and they'll be blood on their hands from these changes.

Reddit,"We absolutely need to remove stamp duty, lower income taxes to mid to high earners, introduce property taxes, cut back on building regulations, lower energy costs (looking at you net zero), reverse Brexit, subidise childcare costs, reduce rail costs and reduce corporate taxes.. Alright, hear me out—this could be a game-changer for the UK economy and living standards. So imagine this - we scrap stamp duty (because let’s be real, it’s just a barrier to people moving homes) and replace it with a fairer property tax. This alone could boost housing transactions by 10%, adding billions to the economy and making it easier for first-time buyers and families to move up the ladder. Plus, cutting income taxes for mid-to-high earners isn’t just about helping the “wealthy”—it’s about putting more money in the pockets of people who spend it locally, boosting small businesses and high streets. Studies show that every £1 in tax cuts can generate £1.50 in economic activity.

Now, let’s talk about childcare and rail costs. Subsidising childcare isn’t just a win for parents—it’s a win for the economy. For every £1 spent, we get £4 back in increased productivity and workforce participation. And cheaper rail fares? That’s a no-brainer. It means more people can afford to commute to better-paying jobs, reducing regional inequality and helping struggling town centres.

Oh, and energy costs—rethinking net zero targets (without abandoning them entirely) could save households £150 a year and slash business overheads, making UK companies more competitive globally. Lower corporate taxes? That’s about attracting investment and creating jobs—think 100,000+ new roles in sectors like tech and manufacturing. Especially with AI's power hungry requirements, we need to tackle this now!

And yeah, I’ll say it: reversing Brexit could be a massive boost. Restoring seamless trade with the EU (43% of our exports pre-Brexit) would mean cheaper goods, more jobs, and stronger supply chains. Even cutting back on red tape in building regulations could unlock £18 billion in infrastructure projects by 2030, creating jobs and fixing our crumbling roads and public spaces.

Additionally, we need to boost our strengths. Our financial sector, university sector and tourism could also boost things considerably. We need to cut red tape in finance so we can continue to dominate, Universities bring in huge amounts of international revenue, we should be throwing money into that because we have a massive advantage of the rest of the world there. This also relates to reducing taxes on the mid to high income earners. 

Why the f\*ck would I stay and lecture in a Uni when I could get a job in the US paying 5-10x that salary?

Bottom line? These changes would mean more money in your pocket, better job opportunities, and a stronger economy that works for almost everyone—not just the top 1%. Who’s with me?

Reddit,"How can Labour’s proposed welfare reforms work mathematically?. I've been following Labour’s recent announcement on welfare reform, specifically targeting economically inactive individuals (around 9.29 million people in the UK, including carers, disabled individuals, etc.). The idea is to encourage or push more of these individuals into employment.

However, recent statistics indicate there are only around 819,000 job vacancies available. Additionally, about 1.56 million people in the UK are currently classified as unemployed. This already substantial gap raises serious questions about the practicality of moving even more economically inactive people into the workforce.

Furthermore, considering automation and advancements in AI potentially reducing job opportunities further, how can this proposal realistically work when there could be even fewer job openings in the future?

I'd appreciate hearing any insights or alternative perspectives on this issue.

🚌The £3 cap on bus fares is being extended, putting more money back in your pocket. 

🏥NHS waiting lists have fallen to their lowest level in two years, with nearly a quarter of a million off NHS waiting lists since July.

🏭The biggest nuclear building programme in a generation will create 10,000 new jobs, provide energy security, and bring growth to all corners of our country.

💻A national skills drive will see 1 million secondary school students given the skills and tools needed to get the AI-powered jobs of the future.

Reddit,"Are UK Companies Overlooking Local Talent by Outsourcing High-Skill Jobs Abroad? . Hi, I would like to discuss the trend of UK companies hiring from emerging and developed countries such as India, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, and China. These companies often pay wages that are higher relative to the local purchasing power parity (PPP) compared to the UK. Considering the average wage in the UK ranges from £25,000 to £35,000, and the cost of living is significantly higher, I believe this practice can be concerning for British students and graduates.

For instance, even retail companies like Tesco have moved many of their Software Development Engineer roles to locations like Bangalore and Mumbai. This shift is evident from their careers page, which shows a higher count of advanced job listings in India compared to the UK. It raises the question of whether we have an adequate number of Computer Science and Data Science students in the UK, who are equally skilled in Machine Learning, Software Development, FinTech, and AI. Many UK graduates with advanced degrees would welcome the opportunity to work as a Software Development Engineer at Tesco for £40,000. However, these opportunities seem to be outsourced.

I understand that, prior to COVID-19, hiring abroad could reduce company costs, but I am curious if this still holds true. Job portals indicate that salaries for roles such as Project Managers in India are now comparable to those in the UK, around £50,000. This has been confirmed through conversations with friends and family abroad. If the salaries are similar, why not hire locally in the UK? Is it a case that UK workers are perhaps not skilled enough, even though we rank in the top 10-20 for the Global Innovation Index and ease of doing business?

This post is not intended to disparage the mentioned nations. My concern is with UK companies overlooking skilled and hard-working individuals within the UK. Advanced technology jobs, which offer high salaries, seem to be moving abroad, while the remaining jobs in the UK offer salaries that struggle to keep up with living expenses like food, rent, and insurance.

While I understand the capitalist perspective of minimizing costs by outsourcing, this justification seems less valid when companies pay £50,000+ abroad and offer similar salaries for the same roles in the UK. If the productivity and skill levels are comparable, as indicated by the UK's top 15 ranking for productivity on WEF rankings, why not hire locally? Any insights welcome, especially given we have a general election coming up and the economic growth debate appears less important on TV than they usually doldrums about immigration, national security, energy security - all of these can be partially solved by truly focusing on wage growths locally?",2024-06-15 11:23:32,/r/ukpolitics/comments/1dgfsw5/are_uk_companies_overlooking_local_talent_by/,are uk companies overlooking local talent by outsourcing highskill jobs abroad hi i would like to discuss the trend of uk companies hiring from emerging and developed countries such as india thailand south korea vietnam and china these companies often pay wages that are higher relative to the local purchasing power parity ppp compared to the uk considering the average wage in the uk ranges from to and the cost of living is significantly higher i believe this practice can be concerning for british students and graduates for instance even retail companies like tesco have moved many of their software development engineer roles to locations like bangalore and mumbai this shift is evident from their careers page which shows a higher count of advanced job listings in india compared to the uk it raises the question of whether we have an adequate number of computer science and data science students in the uk who are equally skilled in machine learning software development fintech and ai many uk graduates with advanced degrees would welcome the opportunity to work as a software development engineer at tesco for however these opportunities seem to be outsourced i understand that prior to covid hiring abroad could reduce company costs but i am curious if this still holds true job portals indicate that salaries for roles such as project managers in india are now comparable to those in the uk around this has been confirmed through conversations with friends and family abroad if the salaries are similar why not hire locally in the uk is it a case that uk workers are perhaps not skilled enough even though we rank in the top for the global innovation index and ease of doing business this post is not intended to disparage the mentioned nations my concern is with uk companies overlooking skilled and hardworking individuals within the uk advanced technology jobs which offer high salaries seem to be moving abroad while the remaining jobs in the uk offer salaries that struggle to keep up with living expenses like food rent and insurance while i understand the capitalist perspective of minimizing costs by outsourcing this justification seems less valid when companies pay abroad and offer similar salaries for the same roles in the uk if the productivity and skill levels are comparable as indicated by the uks top ranking for productivity on wef rankings why not hire locally any insights welcome especially given we have a general election coming up and the economic growth debate appears less important on tv than they usually doldrums about immigration national security energy security all of these can be partially solved by truly focusing on wage growths locally,0,0_ai_uk_artificial_intelligence,neutral,0.5834446549415588,curiosity,0.7364219427108765

Reddit,"Benefit Reduction Policy is Old Fashioned. I wanted to see what others think about the benefit reduction policy revealed by Jeremy Hunt today. 

His policy is to tighten up on number of people claiming disability benefit and make it more beneficial for people to get into work. 

I also wanted to look at these policies framed within some of the wider conversations that have been happening around AI. There is a worry shared by some very influential people in the tech world such as Elon Musk that we are getting closer to needing a universal basic income due to there not being the jobs available for all with the enhancements in AI. With this in mind, the reduction in disability benefit seems to be old fashioned and going in the wrong direction. This combined with the approach being to take away the money but not provide the services and facilities required to get these people back into work. 

We need to also be clear the people who are being targeted with this, these are not just people who are too lazy to work, they are people who have at some point have had a disability that has meant it is impossible or very difficult to work. It might be some of these people are able to do certain work and they should be encouraged to do so but that should be by ensuring the money they make working is more than they get on benefits and that its worthwhile. The worry i have is that people who are unable to work will be pushed down a path where they eventually end up with no support and i can't see how that will be better for society in the long run. 

These people also tend to be the poorest in society, anyone who has a disability will likely agree people with disabilities often face the most discrimination and find it the hardest to access services. So i am finding it hard to see this as anything other than an attack on the poorest (who are normally not tory voters) in society and a regressive policy trying to shift the blame off of the government for having lost billions and onto the most vulnerable in society who have little ability to push back.

Reddit,"Thoughts on the Public Sector productivity issues/other wider issues. I have recently began working in the public sector for a local authority, and I was surprised how inept certain aspects of *the wider culture* is in the public sector. This may or may not be similar in other areas of the public sector, but these are some of my thoughts, experiences and issues with it.

- Productivity has decreased or broadly stayed the same over the last 20-25 years. This has been exacerbated by Covid, the multiple economic crises and various other wider problems. Resources are more stretched, and the public services don't utilise public funds as well as it could do. 

- I think there are lots of reasons for point 1 -, and I'll try and touch on some them. They range from social, to the cultural and economic aspects that I think holds the PS back from delivering public services and implementing govt. policies more efficiently. 

1 - Inept people/lack of skills. 
This is a big one for me. Some people in the Public Sector are resistant to improving skills with technology and skills more widely. People see it as a job for life, and once you are in the door I think it can be too hard to kick you out of the door if you don't perform that well. A lot of this stems from poor management, and managers not understanding how to improve themselves and others. For example, some people in the public sector are inept at using computers and technology. Some want to learn and improve, but others don't. Some can't/won't use Excel and Teams, or even tech like self service systems to get payslips so rely on council sending paper to them.

2 - Archaic technology. 
The public service seems to have a bizarre obsession with paper and printers. Printers are old, often break, are tempeamental and it is better to communicate and send things virtually. Letters are sent out to people needlessly, computer systems/printing systems are old and dysfunctional, and there seems to be a culture if sticking with the status quo rather than utilising things new tech like AI. 

3 - Lack of incentives for doing above what is expected.
 Pay isn't the best, and despite it rising, inflation has also risen too which has eaten into our paychecks. This obviously eats into morale. Because many areas are struggling with finances, bonuses are tiny/non-existent for good performance & more widely, and it feels like there are no incentives to do anything more than you need to do. Working harder than you need to can actively disadvantage you in fact, as it can prove to those above that they have hired too many staff with there not being enough work to go around. There is no opportunity to innovate or think outside of the box, and this is actively discouraged at times. 

4 - Managers not being in tune with those below them
Often, managers come from other places and don't really have an understanding of the issues of those on the front line. It doesn't help if you haven't done the job before, and many haven't. There seems to a general lack of understanding of the varying issues with process, culture and skills of those below them.

5 - Economic crises and uncertainty
Councils and PS have had to save huge amounts of money over the past 10-15 years, and seem to offer bare-bones levels of services. Morale inside the public sector is bad, and public trust/perception of public sector/councils/other areas of PS is understandably bad. 

6 - Social care crisis
Vast amounts of council sums from council tax, adult social care tax and other funding are spent on Adult social care. The whole council tax system is bad and regressive, and the social care system needs huge reform to save councils from ever increasing costs given the demographic issues of the future regarding an aging population that will live longer and have more complex issues for longer. 

This isn't an exhaustive list or one aimed at offering solutions, it was just some some thoughts from someone who currently works in the area.

Reddit,"UK Budget – Podcast predictions vs reality - 2 weeks analysis pre/post. Hi,

I've taken a particular interest in politics over recent years, so I jump at any reason to run some analysis.

Since I spend an embarrassing amount of time building tech to analyze podcasts, I thought I'd take a look at the ""court of podcast appeal"" around the UK budget.

I found all podcast discussions with both ""Reeves"" and ""budget"" were mentioned, and then ran all of the results through an analysis pipeline.

I'l caveat and say that this might not be the most scientific study in the world. However, directionally the analysis feels directionally accurate at the very least, and also it's interesting to see all podcasts that are discussing this topic in detail (I include a full list of sources at the [bottom of the page here](https://www.podengine.ai/articles/uk-budget-oct-2024-analysis)).

# The Setup

In the weeks leading up to the Spring Budget 2024, podcast experts were confident about one thing: Rachel Reeves would not raise taxes on businesses or middle-income families. This was a central commitment in her election campaign, which promised fiscal prudence without harming small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or burdening the working class with new taxes.

>""This upcoming budget won't see taxes raised for the average worker. Rachel Reeves has been clear on this since the start of her campaign, and I don't see any room for last-minute policies that could shock voters.""  
*-- Today in Parliament, Westminster Special* (Oct 25, 2024)

Despite the certainty among these experts, what actually happened painted a very different picture.

Rachel Reeves, in an unexpected and dramatic departure from her campaign rhetoric, announced the largest post-war tax hike, including increases in employers' National Insurance, capital gains tax, and inheritance tax. The total value of tax increases amounted to £40 billion, directly affecting businesses across the UK. This fiscal shock spooked market analysts, sending the yield on 10-year gilts up by 25 basis points and reigniting bond market fears that were last seen during the disastrous Liz Truss budget.

>""Increased employer taxes during a cost-of-living crisis? This is insane. It's effectively a body blow for SMEs, with higher hiring costs forcing painful choices — layoffs or stagnation.""  
*-- Wake Up to Money* (Oct 31, 2024)

# Methodology

This analysis focused on 75+ top podcasts, including episodes from leading UK economics, political, and business podcasts. We analyzed both pre- and post-budget discussions from shows such as *Today in Parliament*, *Wake Up to Money*, *The New Statesman Podcast*, and niche financial commentary podcasts like *Macrodose* and *The Expert Factor*. Podcasts were selected based simply on the presence of them discussing the budget and Rachael Reeves, ensuring a blend of political, journalistic, and financial analysis to cover a wide range of perspectives on Reeves' first budget.

Our methodology involved:

* Searching all podcast discussions using the [Pod Engine](https://www.podengine.ai/search) search API (I created this 
* Ran each discussion found through an analysis pipeline using a few different tools ([Retool](https://retool.com/) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) were the most useful)
* Ran the same analysis pre and post budget day
* Summarized using a combination of AI and manual checks

# The Predictions That Crumbled

# 1. ""No New Taxes for Businesses""

Leading up to the 2024 Spring Budget, the overwhelming consensus across financial commentary was that Rachel Reeves would stick to her campaign promises. Almost every expert predicted no significant tax increases, especially for businesses. Yet, Reeves blindsided industries by raising employers' National Insurance contributions by 1.2 percentage points and increasing capital gains tax and inheritance tax.

>""Rachel Reeves is not going to make any hasty moves that could jeopardize business confidence. From everything we've heard on the campaign trail, she'll focus on balancing the books without imposing new burdens on employers.""  
*-- UK Politics Weekly* (Oct 27, 2024)

# Post-Budget Reality

>""Businesses are facing a squeeze like never before. Increasing employer National Insurance will stifle growth and reduce hiring. It's a colossal tax burden during a period when companies are already grappling with inflation.""  
*-- Macrodose: Special Edition* (Nov 1, 2024)

# 2. ""Minimal Taxation necessary for Fiscal Health""

Another common prediction was that Labour would use the 2024 Budget to improve public finances without shocking market movements or causing a significant realignment in business taxes. This idea stemmed from the campaign's repeated claims that Labour could fund NHS and education investment without major tax hikes through efficiency measures.

>“Expect minimal meddling with taxes—the focus will be on trimming inefficient public spending rather than taxing businesses or households.”  
*-- Times News Briefing* (Oct 26, 2024)

In contrast to these expectations, Rachel Reeves introduced one of the largest net-tax-hiking budgets in modern UK history, signaling an irreversible shift from fiscal restraint to a more heavy-handed economic intervention approach.

>""This is a surprising contradiction. We were led to believe that growth would come through careful management with subtle fiscal shifts. Instead, Reeves has rolled out tax hikes that could sink business confidence entirely.""  
*-- Wake Up to Money* (Nov 02, 2024)

# 3. ""Optimism in Economic Growth by 2026""

Several podcasts predicted that despite economic turbulence, the government's measures would set the UK on a growth trajectory by 2026. This optimism was directly tied to pre-budget leaks suggesting big promises for infrastructure investment and GDP growth driven by increased investment in public services.

>""We're going to see things recover. Inflation will subside, growth will ensue, and Reeves' strategic public spending will bring about the economic renewal Labour promises.""  
*-- The New Statesman Podcast* (Oct 25, 2024)

However, immediately following the budget release, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revised its growth forecasts downward, warning that GDP might contract in the next fiscal year and stagnate in the following two. Podcast hosts scrambled to reevaluate their earlier enthusiasm.

>""What we're looking at here is an economic gamble, and it doesn't seem like it will pay off anytime soon. GDP shortfalls, debt levels sky-high, and interest rising will freeze future growth. This is ultimately a risky move.""  
*-- One of Our Times* (Oct 31, 2024)

# Expert Opinion Evolution

The tone of pre-budget podcasts was one of cautious optimism, reflecting a consensus that Rachel Reeves would respect her campaign promises of fiscal restraint combined with targeted economic growth measures. However, this narrative quickly collapsed when the budget revealed a very different set of priorities.

# The Initial Consensus: No Major Tax Increases

Before the budget, experts were fairly aligned in believing that Reeves would promote a cautious approach, balancing fiscal challenges through minor adjustments and a “steady as she goes” economic policy rather than large-scale interventions.

>“We expect slight tax nudges, maybe an adjustment here or there for high earners, but overall this should be a minimal shift for most businesses and families.”  
*-- Political Insider, UK Special* (Oct 28, 2024)

# The Moment of Realization: Sudden Shock

As news of the Employers' National Insurance hike broke, expert predictions crumbled. Many commentators quickly backpedaled, stunned by the scale of the changes once thought impossible.

>""There's no escaping it—this is the sharpest U-turn we've seen from Labour in years. It's a dramatic reshuffling of their fiscal priorities and a real body blow to businesses.""  
*-- Times Political Cast* (October 31, 2024)

# The New Reality: Tough Decisions

The abrupt shift in policy divided many experts, with some arguing the changes were necessary but mistimed, while a majority condemned the new taxes as punitive to businesses already struggling.

>""We're going to feel pain, especially in the SME sector. This is not growth; this is survival, and the budget today makes it harder for employers to retain staff.""  
*-- Walker Cripps Macro Report* (Nov 02, 2024)

# Key Measures Analysis

To provide a more comprehensive understanding, we broke down the major budget measures as discussed across the podcasts into categories of initial support versus post-budget support. Below are the results:

|**Measure**|**Initial Support %**|**Post-Budget Support %**|**Pre-Budget Quote**|**Post-Budget Reaction**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NHS Investment (£22.6bn)|60%|50%|""This might be one of the few areas where Reeves could save face, as NHS funding must grow."" - *Newscast* (Oct 29, 2024)|""£22bn? Great headline, but NHS inefficiencies are systemic and deep. Money won't fix it now."" - *Today in Focus* (Nov 02, 2024)|
|Employers' National Insurance (+1.2% Rate)|30%|15%|""National Insurance increases seem politically infeasible—Labour has walked away already."" - *Westminster Preview* (Oct 29, 2024)|""Disastrous. This is just going to squeeze SMEs and damage job creation."" - *Wake Up to Money* (Nov 01, 2024)|
|Education Funding (£6.7bn)|65%|55%|""We can expect Labour to prioritize education promotion while balancing the budget."" - *Janet Daily* (Nov 01, 2024)|""Spending is up, but cash alone won't reform schools."" - *Times Weekly* (Nov 02, 2024)|

# Hidden Patterns

There were key overlooked elements in the 2024 Spring Budget that subtly shaped broader responses from experts, which emerged clearly in our analysis of podcasts.

# 1. Preemptive Leaks as Market Stabilization

>""There's been a substantial move towards transparency. Rachel Reeves has made efforts beyond what any prior Chancellor has done, particularly in pre-disclosing her fiscal changes to avoid market panic.""  
*-- Newscast, October Budget Breakdown*

The slew of pre-budget leaks, orchestrated by Reeves, initially aimed to calm markets by avoiding any ""Truss-style"" meltdowns. On closer inspection, several podcast hosts pointed out this early media saturation alleviated much of the shock that might have been more impactful during the official release.

However, as *Politics at Jack & Sam's* explained, these early leaks suggested substantial internal uncertainty within Labour about how the market would react, and many suspect the leaks telegraphed larger internal doubts about the business tax increases, which Reeves later committed to fully.

This shift in communication strategy, while blunting immediate reactions, also served to reduce broader economic trust in future Labour disclosures due to its clear attempts to adjust psychic harm caused by fiscal realities.

# 2. Crowding Out the Private Sector

One of the more subtle yet damaging fiscal shifts discussed was the crowding out of private investment due to the scale of public sector investment in the 2024 Budget. After the announcement, bond markets reacted negatively, with 10-year gilts rising by 25 basis points, a move described by *Walker Cripps Market Analysis* as indicative of investors fleeing UK debt.

>""Reeves' public sector push will throttle capital availability in the long-term, limiting long-term innovation and growth for UK businesses.""  
*-- Macrodose Economic Byte* (Nov 2, 2024)

# Technical Insights Made Simple

One of the most glaring financial risks highlighted across the podcasts was Rachel Reeves' use of asset sales and government-held equity as collateral to mitigate debt.

>""Collateralizing public assets to cover the deficit is more than a fiscal gimmick—it's a thinly-veiled method to make debt sustainability look better on paper, while potentially destabilizing markets in the event of asset underperformance.""  
*-- Political Currency, Post-Budget Review* (Nov 03, 2024)

By relying on public asset sales in future budgets, Reeves may have created short-term fiscal maneuvers but at the expense of long-term sustainability. This move, while largely ignored by many early pre-budget analyses, demonstrated a technical risk whereby fluctuating asset markets could contribute to future financial collapses during downturn cycles.

# Future Implications

As post-budget episodes emerged, experts shifted focus towards long-term consequences beyond 2024.

# 1. The Wage Conundrum

Initially hailed as a pro-worker budget due to minimum wage increases, further commentary revealed an ugly truth—wage growth might stagnate from 2025 onward, particularly for private sector employees.

>""Private-sector real wages may thin out, compounded by employer taxes and higher inflation. Any immediate increases could give way to stagflation in 2 years.""  
*-- Walker Bricks, November Mid-Cycle Financial Report*

# 2. Debt and Growth Plateau by 2030

Several experts on shows like *Bloomberg UK Market Digest* highlighted an ominous trend embedded in the OBR's projections—while Labour aims for mid-decade growth, the long-term forecasts suggest stagnation by 2030, as debt accrual limits GDP growth beyond that point.

>""The aura wears off fast—by 2029, borrowing costs and rising tax burdens create stagnation in capital markets, leading inevitably to a post-2030 growth plateau.""  
*-- Bloomberg UK Market Weekly* (Nov 02, 2024)

# Conclusion

Rachel Reeves' 2024 Spring Budget defied the confident predictions of podcast experts across the UK financial and political ecosystem. **80%** of initial predictions regarding tax rates, fiscal measures, and business implications ultimately missed the mark, forcing major post-budget re-evaluations. From increases in the Employers' National Insurance to the vicious crowding out of private sector funds, this budget has largely reset expectations for the UK's economy going forward—revealing the complex balance Reeves must now strike between paying for public services and spurring private-sector growth.

While long-term gains remain theoretically possible, current expert sentiment is cautious, with major concerns about debt sustainability, limited SME growth, and weak future GDP performance. Time will tell if Reeves' gambles will pay off, but for now, experts are left questioning far more than they had three weeks prior.

Reddit,"Is Automation the biggest threat to capitalism.. 
I've recently been doing a bit of reading on the subject of automation. I was staggered to discover just how many industries have the potential to be autonomous. 

There are the obvious industries: logistics, manufacturing and transport. But there are other industries which face the possibility of automation as well, for example warehousing, administration, hospitality (waitresses and chefs), healthcare industry, agriculture,  rubbish collection and they have even designed an automated tattoo machine. 

I'd imagine that this list isn't even close to exhaustive. 

If such widespread automation were ever to materialise, it would obviously cause widespread redundancies and unemployment. The massive spike in frictional unemployment would likely have a massive impact on the education system, as more and more people seek to retrain. But universities can only take so many people, so presumably they'd have to ask the government for assistance. But failing that, surely they would have to increase tuition fees to cope with the increasing expenses? 

Also, if most of the menial job have been automated, how are people even going to pay their way through uni? Without some sort of government assistance, I'd imagine that we are going to see ever increasing numbers of people who are unemployed and unable to retrain. 

I've read that between 45-57% of the U.S workforce are at risk of automation, compared to 35% in the U.K. The stats are even worse in the developing world as a whopping 77% of the workforce in China can be replaced by automation. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/robots-will-steal-your-job-citi-ai-increase-unemployment-inequality-2016-2?r=UK&IR=T&IR=T

During the Great Depression, unemployment in the US was ~ 20% and around ~17% in the UK (please correct me if I'm wrong). But it appears that Automation stands to make unemployment much higher than that. Let's say 45% of jobs in the US get automated, presumably the unemployment rate would be roughly 45% as well. If the US experienced that level of unprecedented unemployment, then surely aggregate demand would be decimated?  

The vast amount of unemployed people would presumably save what little cash they have, massively reducing the demand for goods. Disinflation would inevitably ensue but as the interest rates in most major countries are already at record lows, what could the government possibly do to stop it? Before we know it, we have deflation and the economy is in terminal decline.  Many businesses would be unable to shift their stock, and many would eventually have to close their doors. Which would of course increase unemployment even more! And the cycle continues. 

I'm of the opinion that Automation doesn't have to be a bad thing. But we have to be prepared for it. How can politicians be so blind to such a calamitous event that is just on the horizon. While Theresa May centres her 2020 election campaign on pulling out of the ECHR, automation edges closer and closer. It alarms me that most politicians appear completely obvious to automation, and they are the ones who are supposed to come up with a plan for it. 

My hopes are not high for the future at this stage.

It's like capitalism's perpetual search for efficiency will finally be the thing that kills it. Yet we are all going into this blind. 


(btw I'm studying Economics at AS level, so if there is anything I've overlooked, or if I'm wrong about anything, then please let me know!)

Reddit,"Thoughts on Universal Basic Income?. As more and more jobs are becoming automated I often wonder why this isn't discussed more in the UK political sphere, recently it's been getting more attention and support across several countries in europe as well as a handful outside of Europe, I'm interested to hear peoples thoughts on this, will it ever be viable? If so when do you think would be the right time to implement it? Do you believe automation is occurring to slowly for this to even be a concern?

Personally I believe that in 10 years time most of the western world will need to look more seriously at policies like this, already there are several technologies that are only around the corner and some that already exist which will replace jobs.

Some examples:

* Self-Service checkouts

* Self-Driving viechles

* Automated robots in manufacturing/warehouse

* Vertical Farming

* 3D printing (both small scale and 3D printed housing)

* Drones/Robotic military stuff
* Bitcoin/decentralized networks & autonomous companies

Reddit,"We would not run out of food in the event of Hard Brexit because HMG would limit the amount of goods presented to ports for clearance in EU States to allow free flow of food and health checks would be waived by invoking the WTO national security exemption (Article XX1 (b)(iii)). Waiver: https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/gatt_ai_e/art21_e.pdf

@http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86956

The price we will have to pay for this is a massive reduction of goods exported to EU Member States – which may be to an extent mitigated by stockpiling goods on the continent (and in non-EU states) to keep customers supplied after Brexit. 

But bearing in mind that the export of live animals and products of animal origin to EU Member States will be prohibited in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, we can expect a glut of certain commodities as they find their way onto the domestic market, and even a price crash. This dynamic will, however, drive many producers out of business, leading to shortages in the longer term. 

If there is any likelihood of food shortages, the most probable cause will be panic buying. This has the capability of stripping supermarket shelves bare, even when there are no actual shortages. The government may need to impose emergency limits on the amounts of specific commodities any one individual can buy, and even make hoarding them a criminal offence. 

In the absence of government action, the supermarkets may voluntarily impose their own limits, which could have the effect of damping down demand. 

There is then the matter of medicines, where some pundits are also suggesting that shortages may occur. In this sector, though, stockpiling is a realistic proposition. Perversely, EU Member States are at greater risk, as medicines produced under the control of UK establishments (even if they are manufactured in EU Member States) may not be authorised for sale in any of the EU states. 

Of all the headline issues that may become apparent, post Brexit, is aviation. Once we drop out of European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) and the aviation safety acquis, administered by EASA, the effects on UK aviation will be widespread and profound. 

Rothwell, for the Telegraph relies on the view of chancellor Philip Hammond, who said: ""It is theoretically conceivable in a no-deal scenario that there will be no air traffic moving between the UK and EU on 29 March 2019. But I don't think anybody seriously believes that is where we will get to"".

For my part, it is extremely difficult to see how the legal issues in civil aviation can be resolved without intensive negotiations and a complex raft of agreements. In the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, therefore, some disruption is inevitable and the odds favour a complete shut-down, even if only for a matter of days while emergency agreements are stitched together – allowing limited UK services. 

The approach to aviation, however, typifies the way many pundits handle a ""no deal"" Brexit. Many of the consequences are so extreme that disbelief sets in. As with Hammond, the view is taken that because they are so extreme, they cannot be allowed to happen and therefore, that they won't happen. 

Nevertheless, I think we must prepare for the likelihood that the export of motor vehicles will cease. Even where manufacturers have been able to transfer type approvals to EU Member State regulators, production supervision arrangements will not be in place, rendering existing approvals invalid. 

The same goes for any civil aviation products, including finished aircraft and assemblies such as Airbus wings and aircraft engines. One cannot simply offshore the regulatory approval here, because controls are embedded right throughout the design and manufacturing processes. 

Across the board, the export of many manufactured goods will cease. This will apply where they require third party certification from ""notified bodies"" and have relied on certificates from UK bodies. These will no longer be valid. Chemicals which lack REACH approval will also be excluded from the European market. 

Live animal export will, of course, be prohibited, but this will probably also apply to the movement of pet animals without quarantine, and the transport of racehorses direct to France and Ireland, without veterinary control and supervision. Also on the sporting front, Formula 1 racing will be badly affected. 

Recently, we have learned that a substantial amount of recyclable domestic refuse is exported to EU Member States, particularly Poland. This will no longer be possible. 

Once we get into this sort of detail though, the legacy media is nowhere to be seen. Their journalists lack the capability (or the motivation) to offer anything other than the most superficial of pictures. (http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86697)

The closest I've seen recently is oddly enough in the The Telegraph, where Jeremy Warner reports under the heading: ""Let's be honest about a no-deal Brexit; it has nothing to offer but blood, toil, sweat and tears"". (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/08/07/honest-no-deal-brexit-has-nothing-offer-blood-toil-sweat-tears/)

Denying that there problems related to a ""no deal"" Brexit is, he writes, ""verging on the delusional"". And although Warner's grasp of the detail is sketchy – as is understanding of the legal background to the application of non-tariff barriers, he does at least recognise that the EU makes it plain that Britain becomes a third country from the moment it exits. 
Without some form of dispensation, he writes (not appreciating that this is not possible in a ""no deal"" scenario), he warns that ""all those myriad tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade immediately kick in"". And although he thinks this ""may be legalistic and irrational"", this ""is the law. There is almost no business that takes place outside a legal framework of this sort"".

One example he offers is selling medical equipment in the EU, which requires a certificate – or Conformité Européene marking – to show required standards are met. These certificates, he notes, are pretty much automatic for EU members, and as it happens are substantially written here in the UK for the EU as a whole, but would cease to be valid for UK suppliers when Britain becomes a third country. UK certification authorities will no longer be recognised. 

Even if the UK said it planned to remain fully compliant with the EU, including ECJ rulings on such matters, the EU could ""if it wished to play hardball"" either refuse such certificates or subject British medical equipment to vigorous border controls to ensure compliance"". 

Wrongly, Warner asserts that ""some countries – Switzerland, Australia and Turkey – enjoy mutual recognition with the EU on medical equipment standards"" - which is not the case. The man is confusing recognition of standards with recognition of conformity assessment.  He is right, though, is saying that such recognition, ""by definition"" requires a deal to be struck. 

As to the WTO, so long as the EU can show it no more discriminates against the UK than any other third country, it would be within the rules. This, says Warner, will be easy enough in all the high value-added trade the UK does with the EU. 

Here, he hasn't quite got it. The man does not seem to understand that the EU is obliged to impose these controls, in order to avoid discriminating against other third countries. Thus, he wrongly sees the EU approach as ""vindictive, economically irrational and self-harming"", even if he acknowledges that the EU ""shows no sign of giving way"" without fully understanding why. 

To raise these points is not to succumb to Project Fear, Warner concludes – in a flash of honesty that is rare in the Telegraph. But what no newspaper (or broadcast media) has yet to do is fully confront the consequences. 

Obviously, the government will do everything it can to take the high-profile issues off the front pages. But what they will not be able to avoid is the torrent of news about business shut-downs and job losses. With the loss of access also to the EU's trade deals, we are effectively looking at the collapse of the UK's export trade. 

An unresolved, ""no deal"" scenario could, by the end of next year, have unemployment running into millions. This will be partially disguised by EU immigrants returning home but, while the government may be partially successful in keeping the queues of lorries off the roads, it will have less success in concealing the size of the dole queues. 

That will be the ultimate ""no deal"" penalty and one which could be with us for a very long time.",2018-08-08

equipment to vigorous border controls to ensure compliance wrongly warner asserts that some countries switzerland australia and turkey enjoy mutual recognition with the eu on medical equipment

high valueadded trade the uk does with the eu here he hasnt quite got it the man does not seem to understand that the eu is obliged to impose these controls in order to avoid discriminating against other third countries thus he wrongly sees the eu approach as vindictive economically irrational and selfharming even if he acknowledges that the eu shows no sign of giving way without fully understanding why to raise these points is not to succumb to project fear warner concludes in a flash of honesty that is rare in the telegraph but what no newspaper or broadcast media has yet to do is fully confront the consequences obviously the government will do everything it can to take the highprofile issues off the front pages but what they will not be able to avoid is the torrent of news about business shutdowns and job losses with the loss of access also to the eus trade deals we are effectively looking at the collapse of the uks export trade an unresolved no deal scenario could by the end of next year have unemployment running into millions this will be partially disguised by eu immigrants returning home but while the government may be partially successful in keeping the queues of lorries off the roads it will have less success in concealing the size of the dole queues that will be the ultimate no deal penalty and one which could be with us for a very long

I don't see how this can be successful if it was implemented now. Please educate me. 

My immediate thoughts:

If I was rich, I would have sold everything and applied for citizenship in another country. But I guess a socialist society can be built without them.

I would also suspect a big decline in foreign investors. Some brain drain of people wanting to get rich or have control of their ideas; so they set up shop abroad.

I suspect a decline in motivation. Several reasons for this: it's probably harder to loose your job, no option of getting rich (more important for men with regards to sexual ""attraction""), resentment towards the government, resentment towards people with fun jobs, no self determined long breaks after hard work... I would loose a lot of motivation in a 100 percent socialist system. I don't see how socialist UK companies can compete with other countries in this environment...

Reddit,"Is the view that we need immigration due to our ageing population compatible with the view that we will soon face mass automation of many jobs?. I'm curious what peoples views are on this issue. One of the main proposed benefits of immigration, is that we have an ageing population with more and more retired pensioners, who need their pension paid for, medical care and social care. As the population ages a larger and larger burden is placed on the working population. By encouraging immigration of mostly young workers we can reduce the level of burden on the working population, by increasing the ratio of workers to pensioners.

However there are many government policy centres that are saying we are also going to face massive automation of jobs over the next few decades. Breakthroughs in machine vision and spacial manipulation of objects are predicted to cut many minimum wage jobs. Robotics are already fast, cheap, agile and strong they just can't see very well or understand the differences between manipulating strong/soft/flexible/rigid objects. Its predicted that these issues will be solved, and the advances in robotics will cost many jobs.

The main area in the news is self-driving vehicles costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the transport sector for taxi drivers/truck drivers/delivery of post and goods. But the principles of the application of computer vision will be similar across almost all jobs. From putting products onto shelf at supermarkets, packing goods at a amazon fulfilment centre, unloading clothes and hanging them at a clothes store and so on.

Many tech companies are working on general AI, that is further away in the future, but none the less its predicted it can impact employment in skilled jobs that require advanced thought/technical skills, so its not just low skilled jobs that might be impacted in the future.

Some people propose things such as universal basic income, as a solution to increased unemployment from technology. But the main issue I wonder about is, if we have a future with double digit unemployment, do we even want immigration?

If unemployment is 30-60% or higher in a post machine vision world, do we benefit from high levels of immigration? Obviously we might benefit from a small number of highly-skiled immigrants in some industries, but what about lower-skiled groups? The more people we get right now to do low skilled jobs, the more people will need supporting in the future once there is no longer a job for them to do.

Is pushing for more immigration of non-highly skilled workers something that will benefit the UK in the medium term (i.e the next 10-25 years) ?",2018-07-03 12:42:34,/r/ukpolitics/comments/8vrvsa/is_the_view_that_we_need_immigration_due_to_our/,is the view that we need immigration due to our ageing population compatible with the view that we will soon face mass automation of many jobs im curious what peoples views are on this issue one of the main proposed benefits of immigration is that we have an ageing population with more and more retired pensioners who need their pension paid for medical care and social care as the population ages a larger and larger burden is placed on the working population by encouraging immigration of mostly young workers we can reduce the level of burden on the working population by increasing the ratio of workers to pensioners however there are many government policy centres that are saying we are also going to face massive automation of jobs over the next few decades breakthroughs in machine vision and spacial manipulation of objects are predicted to cut many minimum wage jobs robotics are already fast cheap agile and strong they just cant see very well or understand the differences between manipulating strongsoftflexiblerigid objects its predicted that these issues will be solved and the advances in robotics will cost many jobs the main area in the news is selfdriving vehicles costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in the transport sector for taxi driverstruck driversdelivery of post and goods but the principles of the application of computer vision will be similar across almost all jobs from putting products onto shelf at supermarkets packing goods at a amazon fulfilment centre unloading clothes and hanging them at a clothes store and so on many tech companies are working on general ai that is further away in the future but none the less its predicted it can impact employment in skilled jobs that require advanced thoughttechnical skills so its not just low skilled jobs that might be impacted in the future some people propose things such as universal basic income as a solution to increased unemployment from technology but the main issue i wonder about is if we have a future with double digit unemployment do we even want immigration if unemployment is or higher in a post machine vision world do we benefit from high levels of immigration obviously we might benefit from a small number of highlyskiled immigrants in some industries but what about lowerskiled groups the more people we get right now to do low skilled jobs the more people will need supporting in the future once there is no longer a job for them to do is pushing for more immigration of nonhighly skilled workers something that will benefit the uk in the medium term ie the next years,-1,-1_to_and_bill_the,neutral,0.6352984309196472,curiosity,0.7695521712303162
Reddit,"Given the recent tube strike, how about a discussion on automation, future technologies and their impacts on society.. [In western society, between 50%-60% of the population aged 15+ are in employment](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS/countries/1W-GB-US-SE-DE-EU?display=graph). With ever increasing use of automation and AI, over the next few decades all physical and mental labour will be automated.

Unemployment is going to rise to serious levels and to combat that, we'll get shorter work weeks and job sharing. It will quickly become apparent how unsuitable this system is as the need to reduce hours increases with automation. Some people will try to fight the automation and fail miserably. During all this, universal basic income (UBI) will continue to gain traction and people will start to demand it. That will be the last concession of capitalism and it's dying breath. 

Alongside the automation of industries, we're also going to see decentralisation as well. With renewable energy and energy storage technologies, lots of places will become self sufficient energy wise and energy will become abundant. With 3D printers continuously improving and the development of atomically precise manufacturing, the whole concept of manufacturing and recycling changes. It becomes possible to download ""patterns"" off the Internet to produce products in your own home from waste products. You can already download such patterns (""Physibles"") off the Pirate Bay for 3D printers. Those patterns could then be modified and customised at will.

And then there's VR which is set to go mainstream in the next couple of years. People were initially dismissive of the Internet and the World Wide Web but over time, it's become ever more popular and useful, and the amount of time people spend using the Internet in some way has increased significantly. VR is going to take that to a whole new level.

VR will initially be a headset and other equipment such as hand controllers and tracking systems with GPUs doing the grunt work. That technology will steadily improve to provide photo-realistic environments and incorporate other senses for better immersion. That technology is not what VR is though. VR is actually an extension of the Internet to the mind and that will become clear to most people as they learn about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). [With DARPA claiming we'll have BCIs in 5 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuPVwGQ9lfY&feature=youtu.be), let's say we'll have them 20 years from now. This technology will allow wireless communication with machines (and by extension other minds) just by thinking. It will also allow ""the blind to see, the deaf to hear and the mute to speak"" by simulating those inputs and outputs. It allows total and complete immersion in VR with the ability to shape those VR environments just by thinking. In short, it allows people to become gods in VR and provides them with ""telekinetic"" and ""telepathic"" abilities in physical reality through technology.

[It's a well know fact that the porn industry are major drivers of technology](http://www.supercompressor.com/vice/how-porn-influenced-technology-8-ways-porn-influenced-tech-supercompressor-com) and VR is the perfect opportunity for them. With a BCI implant, you'd be able to have perfectly realistic sex in VR or the most fantastical sex imaginable. [You won't have to wait for BCIs though to get a taste of what's to come](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/09/how-virtual-reality-porn-could-bring-about-world-peace).

So, as the means of production become ever more automated and decentralised, society is going to become increasingly virtualised. The demand for physical goods is going to decline, replaced by an insatiable demand for abundant digital goods to match a digital lifestyle.

Reddit,"The UK’s Ambitious Journey Towards Becoming an AI Superpower. For the UK to lead in AI, it has to find a balance between innovation, security, and regulation in this rapidly evolving technological landscape but how?

I'm optimistic about AI, I think it could be the missing link that could help us solve any of problems and so it should be prioritised as much as growing the economy and tackling climate change because it will help us significantly achieve both. 

We must tackle the problems of Cyber security to start with, it will be harder to go back and add them later. 

Organisations such as Anthropic and HuggingFace have shown us how to produce better quality large language models, with reduced biases and more factually correct so this is only going to improve rapidly. 

For the UK to lead, each Government department will need to turn it's sights on AI but will need a centre body to provide guidance and governance. 

Many jobs will change, this is a fact we must face head on. AI will create countless jobs but will also mean the end of certain jobs, so we must look to ways we can transition people from one role to another. We are fortunate that this problem isn't as big as the United States and China so we should take full advantage of our size. The UK can lead if we want to, we have to look at our culture and understand the need to take more risk and look how we can learn from failure.

Article:

>**Great Britain: The true extent of Brexit** 
>
>*According to government documents, Great Britain is much worse prepared for a no deal than assumed. The consequences, especially for the economy, would be serious.* 
>
>*An analysis by Bettina Schulz, London* 
>
>19 August 2019, 8:16 a.m. 
>
>When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson travels to Germany for the first time in his new position on Wednesday, he cannot expect much support in the Brexit case. Everything points to Chancellor Angela Merkel sticking to her convictions: The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated.   
Obviously, the British government is already assuming a No Deal anyway. From British government circles, the Sunday Times has been given a confidential cabinet dossier showing the seriousness of the situation: Downing Street expects the EU to treat Britain consistently as a ""third-party state"" from 1 November - with serious economic and political consequences.  
>
>In fact, all licences and authorisations valid within the EU would lose their validity from one day to the next. All goods would have to be covered by detailed customs and supplier declarations, and many chemicals and pharmaceuticals would have to be covered by new import permits - a procedure that would quickly push the export-dependent industry to its limits.   
>
>Even the British government is therefore expecting serious problems: that the time-consuming checks on lorries at the borders will have serious consequences for cross-border trade. British companies can apply for so-called AEO status, which allows simplified clearance at the border. But this normally only applies to companies that regularly trade across borders. However, smaller exporters in particular would be completely overwhelmed by this new bureaucratic act.
>   
>**The beginning of a whole cascade of consequences** 
>
>Mark Carney, central bank governor of the Bank of England, estimated in June that 150,000 of the 250,000 British exporters were not prepared. According to the Sunday Times, the government's dossier shows how dramatic the situation really is: According to the report, up to 85 percent of the trucks on the trade route via the Channel are expected to arrive with the wrong documents after a no-deal brexit - and this could trigger a delay of up to 2.5 days in handling. According to the document, it will probably take up to three months before 50 to 70 percent of the current traffic volume is reached. 
>
>""ACT NOW"" is the warning on the website of the Road Haulage Association (RHA). Anyone who arrives by truck on 1 November without correct papers will not be cleared. It is not for nothing that the government has been planning for a long time how and where exactly the waiting trucks should park. Long traffic jams are to be expected, especially as the British autumn holidays will end on the weekend when Brexit is expected to happen. 
>
>Due to the delay at the borders, the trucks will of course arrive late in the EU and will not be able to collect the goods ordered there on time. This in turn pushes the storage capacities to their limits, as not everything can be kept in stock. Firstly, many warehouses are full to bursting. Secondly, quite apart from fresh food, there are many other goods that cannot be stored endlessly, for example pharmaceutical products such as insulin, but also many chemicals and substances for food production. The consequences for British citizens are obvious: bottlenecks must be expected in the supply of fresh food, medical preparations and even chemicals for the preparation of fresh water. And the dossier does not even describe the disaster scenario for which preparations are under way. It is code-named ""Black Swan"". 
> 
>**The British market is not important enough for EU companies** 
>
>Already today the No-Deal-Brexit casts its shadows ahead. ""No, there's no garlic this week, not even next week,"" many supermarkets say. ""We are currently changing our Spanish supplier."" And Asda, for example, is suddenly selling masses of rice in big bags as well as extra-large bottles of olive oil. People are stocking up, commerce is preparing for No Deal.  
 >
>Slowly, even the last optimists are realising that the prophecies of the followers of a hard Brexit probably won't occur as hoped. ""The Germans want to sell their cars and their pharmaceutical and chemical products here. They will tell Berlin that the EU must conclude a deal with us,"" Sir John Redwood, a conservative MP and No Deal advocate, had said in May. Now, however, things seem to be quite different.     
""Why should we make concessions to Boris Johnson when we couldn't accommodate Theresa May, who was much more diplomatic,"" it's being said in the circles of a German chemical company producing in Great Britain. ""The British market is important, but it is simply not so important to the company group as to make us exert political pressure on Berlin. Asia is more interesting,"" they say. Above all, it is important to keep the internal market intact with all its rules. ""The British overestimate themselves there.""  
>
>A German company that exports equipment for landscape conservation and horticulture to Great Britain is of a similar opinion. ""Great Britain is a good market for us. We will continue to invest there,"" the company says. But do you want to give in? No.   
>
>**""Then we’re ruined.""**
>
>Knowing this, the British government is currently doing everything it can to simplify a no deal. This means, above all, that the government's more than 100 technical instructions for preparing for No Deal still apply. They had already been published last summer by Theresa May's government. In the paper, the government instructs numerous industries to continue to comply unilaterally with most EU regulations, rules and quality standards in the event of No Deal - in order to facilitate trade with the EU. The EU sees it quite differently: in its own 100 preparatory papers for the No-Deal-Brexit, it emphasises that it will treat Great Britain as a third-party state from 1 November.   
There is good reason why the British government is not making this fact official: it means that Britain will adhere to EU rules, even though it has lost all influence in Brussels over the drafting of the rules and has not yet even negotiated secure access to the internal market, as Norway has done. Even Morocco, with its free trade zone with the EU, is already further along in this respect. In principle, the UK would thus be a ""vassal state"" - a state of affairs that Boris Johnson had rigorously rejected as foreign minister under May.   
>
>Meanwhile, the government in London hopes that the EU will certify the British ""equivalence"" at least in selected economic sectors, which would facilitate business with the EU. The EU, for its part, is very selective in this matter: for example, it has awarded equivalence to three London clearing houses, as EU banks conduct their business through the City of London. However, on the topic of exchanging private data, there's isn't yet a willingness to compromise. The cooperation between the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the future British Chemicals Agency is not regulated either. In the event of No Deal, chemicals can only be traded across borders for the time being if they have been registered and approved separately on both sides, i.e. in the EU and the UK.  
>
>**The situation is also serious in terms of foreign policy** 
>
>The consequences of No Deal revealed by the government's dossier are dramatic. The paper does not even address what Britain would do if the EU imposed external tariffs on Britain - which it must do under World Trade Organisation rules. ""This will happen automatically and will of course affect our exports,"" warned central banker Carney in June. ""If the EU did not impose tariffs on us, it would have to lower its tariffs on the Americans and all other countries.""
> 
>What this means is shown just by the example of lamb alone, for which the EU would have to levy a tariff of 48 percent, according to the British agricultural union NGU.   ""Then we'll be ruined,"" complains John Davies, head of the National Farmers' Union in Wales. ""Forty percent of my lamb production goes to export, almost everything to the EU. Nobody will buy that any more"".
>
>And Davies is angry for another reason. Theresa May's government announced back in March that extremely low external tariffs would also apply to imports to Great Britain in the event of No Deal. The ulterior motive: households should be able to buy cheaper. ""We will then no longer be able to sell our lamb in the EU and suddenly have to endure cheap competition from New Zealand,"" says Davis. At the same time, the situation on the labour market is getting worse and worse. The slaughterhouses in Wales, for example, increasingly report that their Polish employees were returning home, says Davies.  
In addition, there is a lack of veterinarians - a job that is often performed by vets from the EU.

thing of style and beauty so blame the ai for inelegant word repetitions etc article great britain the true extent of brexit according to government documents great britain is much worse prepared for a no deal than assumed the consequences especially for the economy would be serious an analysis by bettina schulz london august am when british prime minister boris johnson travels to germany for the first time in his new position on wednesday he cannot expect much support in the brexit case everything points to chancellor angela merkel sticking to her convictions the withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated obviously the british government is already assuming a no deal anyway from british government circles the sunday times has been given a confidential cabinet dossier showing the seriousness of the situation downing street expects the eu to treat britain consistently as a thirdparty state from november with serious economic and political consequences in fact all licences and authorisations valid within the eu would lose their validity from one day to the next all goods would have to be covered by detailed customs and supplier declarations and many chemicals and pharmaceuticals would have to be covered by new import permits a procedure that would quickly push the exportdependent industry to its limits even the british government is therefore expecting serious problems that the timeconsuming checks on lorries at the borders will have serious consequences for crossborder trade british companies can apply for socalled aeo status which allows simplified clearance at the border but this normally only applies to companies that regularly trade across borders however smaller exporters in particular would be completely overwhelmed by this new bureaucratic act the beginning of a whole cascade of consequences mark carney central bank governor of the bank of england estimated in june that of the british exporters were not prepared according to the sunday times the governments dossier shows how dramatic the situation really is according to the report up to percent of the trucks on the trade route via the channel are expected to arrive with the wrong documents after a nodeal brexit and this could trigger a delay of up to days in handling according to the document it will probably take up to three months before to percent of the current traffic volume is reached act now is the warning on the website of the road haulage association rha anyone who arrives by truck on november without correct papers will not be cleared it is not for nothing that the government has been planning for a long time how and where exactly the waiting trucks should park long traffic jams are to be expected especially as the british autumn holidays will end on the weekend when brexit is expected to happen due to the delay at the borders the trucks will of course arrive late in the eu and will not be able to collect the goods ordered there on time this in turn pushes the storage capacities to their limits as not everything can be kept in stock firstly many warehouses are full to bursting secondly quite apart from fresh food there are many other goods that cannot be stored endlessly for example pharmaceutical products such as insulin but also many chemicals and substances for food production the consequences for british citizens are obvious bottlenecks must be expected in the supply of fresh food medical preparations and even chemicals for the preparation of fresh water and the dossier does not even describe the disaster scenario for which preparations are under way it is codenamed black swan the british market is not important enough for eu companies already today the nodealbrexit casts its shadows ahead no theres no garlic this week not even next week many supermarkets say we are currently changing our spanish supplier and asda for example is suddenly selling masses of rice in big bags as well as extralarge bottles of olive oil people are stocking up commerce is preparing for no deal slowly even the last optimists are realising that the prophecies of the followers of a hard brexit probably wont occur as hoped the germans want to sell their cars and their pharmaceutical and chemical products here they will tell berlin that the eu must conclude a deal with us sir john redwood a conservative mp and no deal advocate had said in may now however things seem to be quite different why should we make concessions to boris johnson when we couldnt accommodate theresa may who was much more diplomatic its being said in the circles of a german chemical company producing in great britain the british market is important but it is simply not so important to the company group as to make us exert political pressure on berlin asia is more interesting they say above all it is important to keep the internal market intact with all its rules the british overestimate themselves there a german company that exports equipment for landscape conservation and horticulture to great britain is of a similar opinion great britain is a good market for us we will continue to invest there the company says but do you want to give in no then were ruined knowing this the british government is currently doing everything it can to simplify a no deal this means above all that the governments more than technical instructions for preparing for no deal still apply they had already been published last summer by theresa mays government in the paper the government instructs numerous industries to continue to comply unilaterally with most eu regulations rules and quality standards in the event of no deal in order to facilitate trade with the eu the eu sees it quite differently in its own preparatory papers for the nodealbrexit it emphasises that it will treat great britain as a thirdparty state from november there is good reason why the british government is not making this fact official it means that britain will adhere to eu rules even though it has lost all influence in brussels over the drafting of the rules and has not yet even negotiated secure access to the internal market as norway has done even morocco with its free trade zone with the eu is already further along in this respect in principle the uk would thus be a vassal state a state of affairs that boris johnson had rigorously rejected as foreign minister under may meanwhile the government in london hopes that the eu will certify the british equivalence at least in selected economic sectors which would facilitate business with the eu the eu for its part is very selective in this matter for example it has awarded equivalence to three london clearing houses as eu banks conduct their business through the city of london however on the topic of exchanging private data theres isnt yet a willingness to compromise the cooperation between the european chemicals agency echa and the future british chemicals agency is not regulated either in the event of no deal chemicals can only be traded across borders for the time being if they have been registered and approved separately on both sides ie in the eu and the uk the situation is also serious in terms of foreign policy the consequences of no deal revealed by the governments dossier are dramatic the paper does not even address what britain would do if the eu imposed external tariffs on britain which it must do under world trade organisation rules this will happen automatically and will of course affect our exports warned central banker carney in june if the eu did not impose tariffs on us it would have to lower its tariffs on the americans and all other countries what this means is shown just by the example of lamb alone for which the eu would have to levy a tariff of percent according to the british agricultural union ngu then well be ruined complains john davies head of the national farmers union in wales forty percent of my lamb production goes to export almost everything to the eu nobody will buy that any more and davies is angry for another reason theresa mays government announced back in march that extremely low external tariffs would also apply to imports to great britain in the event of no deal the ulterior motive households should be able to buy cheaper we will then no longer be able to sell our lamb in the eu and suddenly have to endure

Reddit,"Did you all forget Tony Blair ? Labour has always been the most pro-surveillance party in the UK.. For the past days, I've seen a lot of discussions around OSA and online censorship which are ignorant at best. Some say OSA is a Tory policy and Labour just continues it. Others say Labour is too ignorant or technologically illiterate to know any better. 

No. This is Labour's ideology. Remember Tony Blair. 

Tony Blair turned the UK into the most surveilled country on Earth. More than China, more than Russia. He made laws which allowed the collection of DNA from people who were arrested but not charged with a crime ( innocent, random people ) which was declared unlawful by the EU in 2008, similarily the UK had the biggest DNA database in the world under Blair, which isn't a good thing when it happend in such a nefarious way.  
He created 5 Anti-Terror acts which massively expanded surveillance laws, data collection of private citizens, and gave police more authority. He wanted the police to be able to detain people for 90 days without charges, without trial, but that was too draconian so it was ""just"" 28 days detainment, which is still utterly insane.  
The Identity Cards Act wanted mandatory ID cards which included mandatory facial scans and fingerprints. A huge database and national registry was established to collect all data of ID cards. That was shutdown immediatly by the Tory-LibDem coalition in 2010.  
Blair also established a large data collection centers, which collected data, including Metadata from private citizens.

Gordon Brown is not innocent. In 2008 he made a law which made it possible to collect all Data, emails, chat rooms, private messages and web-browsing habits of private citizens. ( The Communications Data Bill of 2008 ). Labour was not able to complete this because they lost the 2010 election. 

When the Tories discussed OSA in 2022, did Labour oppose it ? No they supported it and considered it too weak. They wanted to ban VPNs too.

From 2025. Tony Blair is still at it : [https://idtechwire.com/uks-blair-institute-proposes-national-digital-id-system-linked-to-public-data/](https://idtechwire.com/uks-blair-institute-proposes-national-digital-id-system-linked-to-public-data/) & [https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/live-facial-recognition-would-enhance-uk-justice-says-tony-blair-crime-and-justice-commission-v839qzrlj](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/live-facial-recognition-would-enhance-uk-justice-says-tony-blair-crime-and-justice-commission-v839qzrlj) ... Tony Blair wants the data of all private citizens to feed AI.   
Tony Blair doesn't even hide his political motives ( again in 2025 ) : [https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/tony-blair-use-tech-tough-populism-crime-justice-commission-v58gsvndl](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/tony-blair-use-tech-tough-populism-crime-justice-commission-v58gsvndl) 

Do you remember the Meme about China's social credit system ? Public cameras, and a live feed to immediatly detect the faces of people and to create a national registry where each person's data, profile and face is stored ? That is Labour's vision : 

>*Blair is urging the government to introduce a national digital ID system and roll out live facial recognition cameras to tackle illegal immigration, drive down crime and deal with benefit fraud.*

Everyone has a digital profile stored with the British government. The UK has massive amounts of CCTVs ( the highest per capita during Tony Blair and London as the link above is the 3rd most surveilled city and the only non-Chinese one in the top 10 ). So if you go walk out, all the cameras follow you, identify your face which links to their digital database. They know where you go, when you go and when you return. All data to feed AI and establish your routine.

Now that Labour is back in charge, they continue Blair's ultra surveillance policies. 

I feel like most people active here, either forgot Tony Blair. Or they didn't live through his time in office. What Labour is doing may be authoritarian, draconian or even Orwellian, but it is not surprising. Labour has always been the most pro-surveillance party in the UK. This doesn't excuse the Tories., their 14 years of disaster rule had to come to an end, but make no mistake and think Labour is somehow innocent. 

Under Tony Blair, the excuse was to fight against terrorism. Now the excuse is to fight against predators. It's the same playbook, and the same authoritarian results. 

I just wish we can be level-headed in discussions, and not constantly try to excuse Labour, claim they didn't want this, claim that this is a Tory policy or that Labour is just technologically illiterate. No. This is Labour's ideology. This is what they wanted 15 years ago and it is what they want right now.

Reddit,"Some Facts on Stay Belvedere, and Clear springs collated before February 25. THE BELOW HAS BEEN FORMATTED AND CONDENSED FOR EASE OF READING BY AI
**********
Full Report on Stay Belvedere Properties (SBHL) & Clearsprings Ready Homes

Overview of Their Involvement
Both Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd (SBHL) and Clearsprings Ready Homes are private companies contracted by the UK Home Office to provide accommodation for asylum seekers. While their operations are meant to support the government's strategy of reducing hotel dependency, reports have surfaced regarding profit-driven motives, substandard housing conditions, and regulatory breaches.

Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd (SBHL) 
-Profit-Driven Model: SBHL recorded over £51 million in net profit from its government contracts (Oct 2021 - Sep 2022), highlighting concerns about the high profitability of asylum housing at the taxpayer’s expense ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- Political Ties: The company has been linked to **Crispin Blunt MP**, who receives an annual fee of £15,000 for advisory services, raising ethical concerns ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **Shifting Focus**: SBHL aims to transition towards **longer-term accommodations**, but details remain scarce due to “contractual and legal obligations” ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Clearsprings Ready Homes**  
- **Regulatory Failures**:  
  - The company was **fined £60,586** for operating an unlicensed House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) in Newport, Wales ([Asylum seeker HMO operator fined �60,000 for running house without licence](https://www.landlordzone.co.uk/news/asylum-seeker-hmo-operator-fined-60000-for-running-house-without-licence)).  
  - It failed to comply with housing regulations, including inadequate fire safety measures and missing paperwork when inspected ([Asylum seeker HMO operator fined �60,000 for running house without licence](https://www.landlordzone.co.uk/news/asylum-seeker-hmo-operator-fined-60000-for-running-house-without-licence)).  
- **Massive Profits**: Despite regulatory issues, Clearsprings recorded **£62.5 million in post-tax profit** for 2023, a significant increase from £28 million the previous year ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **10-Year Government Contract**: Clearsprings has secured a **long-term contract until 2029**, shielding it from market fluctuations and competition ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Criticism & Public Backlash**  
- **Charities & Advocacy Groups**: Organizations like Refugee Action and the Scottish Refugee Council have condemned the excessive profits, arguing that asylum housing should not be commercialized ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **Government Stance**: The Home Office justifies its actions by citing legal compliance and efforts to reduce costs by transitioning to cheaper housing alternatives ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Conclusion**  
Both **SBHL and Clearsprings Ready Homes** are profiting substantially from asylum housing contracts, with reported concerns over **substandard living conditions, regulatory breaches, and potential conflicts of interest**. While the government continues to defend its outsourcing approach, public outcry over profiteering at the expense of asylum seekers and taxpayers is growing.",2025-03-26 09:52:16,/r/ukpolitics/comments/1jk82yx/some_facts_on_stay_belvedere_and_clear_springs/,some facts on stay belvedere and clear springs collated before february the below has been formatted and condensed for ease of reading by ai full report on stay belvedere properties sbhl clearsprings ready homes overview of their involvement both stay belvedere hotels ltd sbhl and clearsprings ready homes are private companies contracted by the uk home office to provide accommodation for asylum seekers while their operations are meant to support the governments strategy of reducing hotel dependency reports have surfaced regarding profitdriven motives substandard housing conditions and regulatory breaches stay belvedere hotels ltd sbhl profitdriven model sbhl recorded over million in net profit from its government contracts oct sep highlighting concerns about the high profitability of asylum housing at the taxpayers expense private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing political ties the company has been linked to crispin blunt mp who receives an annual fee of for advisory services raising ethical concerns private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing shifting focus sbhl aims to transition towards longerterm accommodations but details remain scarce due to contractual and legal obligations private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing clearsprings ready homes regulatory failures the company was fined for operating an unlicensed house in multiple occupation hmo in newport wales asylum seeker hmo operator fined for running house without licence it failed to comply with housing regulations including inadequate fire safety measures and missing paperwork when inspected asylum seeker hmo operator fined for running house without licence massive profits despite regulatory issues clearsprings recorded million in posttax profit for a significant increase from million the previous year private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing year government contract clearsprings has secured a longterm contract until shielding it from market fluctuations and competition private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing criticism public backlash charities advocacy groups organizations like refugee action and the scottish refugee council have condemned the excessive profits arguing that asylum housing should not be commercialized private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing government stance the home office justifies its actions by citing legal compliance and efforts to reduce costs by transitioning to cheaper housing alternatives private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing conclusion both sbhl and clearsprings ready homes are profiting substantially from asylum housing contracts with reported concerns over substandard living conditions regulatory breaches and potential conflicts of interest while the government continues to defend its outsourcing approach public outcry over profiteering at the expense of asylum seekers and taxpayers is growing,4,4_the_of_to_and,neutral,0.9188314080238342,neutral,0.9108061194419861

**MPs scrutinise more late-stage bills this week.**

We're at that point in the parliamentary session – it's been almost nine months since the new government came in, and more of its bills are now reaching Royal Assent. Here's a [running list](https://admin.clearthelobby.co.uk/l/Krhw7763TX8qOEP5f3UgBxLw/svKQDbRMsK6GcHyaocpirw/fC0ynNe6oJS763lHNKAAq4Ug) of the bills that have made it across the finish line.

**With Easter approaching, there's surprisingly little time to legislate.**

A rough count shows that when you strip out recess dates, there are only about 13 full weeks between now and September when Parliament is sitting.

**This week's big bill is about product safety rules.**

But in a sense the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill is really about Brexit, because it'd allow the UK to align its product regulations with EU law. Here's a [dive](https://admin.clearthelobby.co.uk/l/Krhw7763TX8qOEP5f3UgBxLw/74AUjh3uOHY0DzL8AUjiZg/fC0ynNe6oJS763lHNKAAq4Ug) into more detail than we have space for in this newsletter.

(South East). **[Barnet](https://opencouncil.network/councils/barnet)** - To address financial challenges, the council is working to bring Capita services back in house. Residents are raising concerns over proposed increases to fees and charges, particularly for visitor parking permits (88% increase) and bulky waste collection.

**[Hackney](https://opencouncil.network/councils/hackney)** - Council is looking at reducing spending and increasing some fees due to a projected overspend. They are considering reducing library hours, building two new children's homes, and automating PCN processing using AI, which will affect staff posts.

Concerns were raised about the over-concentration of student accommodation in the area and the impact of the development on daylight and sunlight for neighbouring properties.
  
**[Newham](https://opencouncil.network/councils/newham)** -  Cheers Bar Lounge in Stratford had its application to vary its licence opposed by a local Councillor due to concerns about public safety, noise, and anti-social behaviour.

**[Southwark](https://opencouncil.network/councils/southwark)** - The Licensing Sub-Committee is considering an application from a bubble tea bar to extend its hours until 6am, but this is facing objections from the council due to concerns about noise and anti-social behaviour. 

**[Surrey](https://opencouncil.network/councils/surrey)** - The controversial London Road Active Travel scheme in Guildford has been rejected by the Cabinet.  Surrey County Council is required to redetermine a planning application for oil extraction at Horse Hill, near Horley, after the Supreme Court ruled that its original decision was unlawful.
  
**[Tower Hamlets](https://opencouncil.network/councils/tower-hamlets)** -  The Tea Garden in Whitechapel was denied a new premises licence due to the applicant's past history of non-compliance. The Quiz Room in Bell Lane was granted a new licence but with additional conditions to address resident concerns about noise. 

**[Wandsworth](https://opencouncil.network/councils/wandsworth)** - The Council has adopted a new constitution which outlines how it operates and the rights of residents.  

**[Westminster](https://opencouncil.network/councils/westminster)** - Radio rooftop bar at the ME Hotel is applying for extended hours and permission for live music.  The Planning Applications Sub-Committee will decide on demolishing a building to be replaced with three homes and whether to allow a building to be used as an embassy. 

**[Greenwich](https://opencouncil.network/councils/greenwich)** -  The council is creating three new Chief Officer roles and approved higher salaries to attract talent in a competitive job market. They are also struggling to fill Greenwich Direct Apprenticeship roles due to budget constraints. The Housing and Litigation Team is facing a significant increase in housing disrepair claims, likely due to an aging housing stock and increased awareness of tenant rights.

The price we will have to pay for this is a massive reduction of goods exported to EU Member States – which may be to an extent mitigated by stockpiling goods on the continent (and in non-EU states) to keep customers supplied after Brexit. 

But bearing in mind that the export of live animals and products of animal origin to EU Member States will be prohibited in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, we can expect a glut of certain commodities as they find their way onto the domestic market, and even a price crash. This dynamic will, however, drive many producers out of business, leading to shortages in the longer term. 

If there is any likelihood of food shortages, the most probable cause will be panic buying. This has the capability of stripping supermarket shelves bare, even when there are no actual shortages. The government may need to impose emergency limits on the amounts of specific commodities any one individual can buy, and even make hoarding them a criminal offence. 

In the absence of government action, the supermarkets may voluntarily impose their own limits, which could have the effect of damping down demand. 

There is then the matter of medicines, where some pundits are also suggesting that shortages may occur. In this sector, though, stockpiling is a realistic proposition. Perversely, EU Member States are at greater risk, as medicines produced under the control of UK establishments (even if they are manufactured in EU Member States) may not be authorised for sale in any of the EU states. 

Of all the headline issues that may become apparent, post Brexit, is aviation. Once we drop out of European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) and the aviation safety acquis, administered by EASA, the effects on UK aviation will be widespread and profound. 

Rothwell, for the Telegraph relies on the view of chancellor Philip Hammond, who said: ""It is theoretically conceivable in a no-deal scenario that there will be no air traffic moving between the UK and EU on 29 March 2019. But I don't think anybody seriously believes that is where we will get to"".

For my part, it is extremely difficult to see how the legal issues in civil aviation can be resolved without intensive negotiations and a complex raft of agreements. In the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit, therefore, some disruption is inevitable and the odds favour a complete shut-down, even if only for a matter of days while emergency agreements are stitched together – allowing limited UK services. 

The approach to aviation, however, typifies the way many pundits handle a ""no deal"" Brexit. Many of the consequences are so extreme that disbelief sets in. As with Hammond, the view is taken that because they are so extreme, they cannot be allowed to happen and therefore, that they won't happen. 

Nevertheless, I think we must prepare for the likelihood that the export of motor vehicles will cease. Even where manufacturers have been able to transfer type approvals to EU Member State regulators, production supervision arrangements will not be in place, rendering existing approvals invalid. 

The same goes for any civil aviation products, including finished aircraft and assemblies such as Airbus wings and aircraft engines. One cannot simply offshore the regulatory approval here, because controls are embedded right throughout the design and manufacturing processes. 

Across the board, the export of many manufactured goods will cease. This will apply where they require third party certification from ""notified bodies"" and have relied on certificates from UK bodies. These will no longer be valid. Chemicals which lack REACH approval will also be excluded from the European market. 

Live animal export will, of course, be prohibited, but this will probably also apply to the movement of pet animals without quarantine, and the transport of racehorses direct to France and Ireland, without veterinary control and supervision. Also on the sporting front, Formula 1 racing will be badly affected. 

Recently, we have learned that a substantial amount of recyclable domestic refuse is exported to EU Member States, particularly Poland. This will no longer be possible. 

Once we get into this sort of detail though, the legacy media is nowhere to be seen. Their journalists lack the capability (or the motivation) to offer anything other than the most superficial of pictures. (http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86697)

The closest I've seen recently is oddly enough in the The Telegraph, where Jeremy Warner reports under the heading: ""Let's be honest about a no-deal Brexit; it has nothing to offer but blood, toil, sweat and tears"". (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/08/07/honest-no-deal-brexit-has-nothing-offer-blood-toil-sweat-tears/)

Denying that there problems related to a ""no deal"" Brexit is, he writes, ""verging on the delusional"". And although Warner's grasp of the detail is sketchy – as is understanding of the legal background to the application of non-tariff barriers, he does at least recognise that the EU makes it plain that Britain becomes a third country from the moment it exits. 
Without some form of dispensation, he writes (not appreciating that this is not possible in a ""no deal"" scenario), he warns that ""all those myriad tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade immediately kick in"". And although he thinks this ""may be legalistic and irrational"", this ""is the law. There is almost no business that takes place outside a legal framework of this sort"".

One example he offers is selling medical equipment in the EU, which requires a certificate – or Conformité Européene marking – to show required standards are met. These certificates, he notes, are pretty much automatic for EU members, and as it happens are substantially written here in the UK for the EU as a whole, but would cease to be valid for UK suppliers when Britain becomes a third country. UK certification authorities will no longer be recognised. 

Even if the UK said it planned to remain fully compliant with the EU, including ECJ rulings on such matters, the EU could ""if it wished to play hardball"" either refuse such certificates or subject British medical equipment to vigorous border controls to ensure compliance"". 

Wrongly, Warner asserts that ""some countries – Switzerland, Australia and Turkey – enjoy mutual recognition with the EU on medical equipment standards"" - which is not the case. The man is confusing recognition of standards with recognition of conformity assessment.  He is right, though, is saying that such recognition, ""by definition"" requires a deal to be struck. 

As to the WTO, so long as the EU can show it no more discriminates against the UK than any other third country, it would be within the rules. This, says Warner, will be easy enough in all the high value-added trade the UK does with the EU. 

Here, he hasn't quite got it. The man does not seem to understand that the EU is obliged to impose these controls, in order to avoid discriminating against other third countries. Thus, he wrongly sees the EU approach as ""vindictive, economically irrational and self-harming"", even if he acknowledges that the EU ""shows no sign of giving way"" without fully understanding why. 

To raise these points is not to succumb to Project Fear, Warner concludes – in a flash of honesty that is rare in the Telegraph. But what no newspaper (or broadcast media) has yet to do is fully confront the consequences. 

Obviously, the government will do everything it can to take the high-profile issues off the front pages. But what they will not be able to avoid is the torrent of news about business shut-downs and job losses. With the loss of access also to the EU's trade deals, we are effectively looking at the collapse of the UK's export trade. 

An unresolved, ""no deal"" scenario could, by the end of next year, have unemployment running into millions. This will be partially disguised by EU immigrants returning home but, while the government may be partially successful in keeping the queues of lorries off the roads, it will have less success in concealing the size of the dole queues. 

That will be the ultimate ""no deal"" penalty and one which could be with us for a very long time.",2018-08-08

Reddit,"Some Facts on Stay Belvedere, and Clear springs collated before February 25. THE BELOW HAS BEEN FORMATTED AND CONDENSED FOR EASE OF READING BY AI
**********
Full Report on Stay Belvedere Properties (SBHL) & Clearsprings Ready Homes

Overview of Their Involvement
Both Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd (SBHL) and Clearsprings Ready Homes are private companies contracted by the UK Home Office to provide accommodation for asylum seekers. While their operations are meant to support the government's strategy of reducing hotel dependency, reports have surfaced regarding profit-driven motives, substandard housing conditions, and regulatory breaches.

Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd (SBHL) 
-Profit-Driven Model: SBHL recorded over £51 million in net profit from its government contracts (Oct 2021 - Sep 2022), highlighting concerns about the high profitability of asylum housing at the taxpayer’s expense ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- Political Ties: The company has been linked to **Crispin Blunt MP**, who receives an annual fee of £15,000 for advisory services, raising ethical concerns ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **Shifting Focus**: SBHL aims to transition towards **longer-term accommodations**, but details remain scarce due to “contractual and legal obligations” ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Clearsprings Ready Homes**  
- **Regulatory Failures**:  
  - The company was **fined £60,586** for operating an unlicensed House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) in Newport, Wales ([Asylum seeker HMO operator fined �60,000 for running house without licence](https://www.landlordzone.co.uk/news/asylum-seeker-hmo-operator-fined-60000-for-running-house-without-licence)).  
  - It failed to comply with housing regulations, including inadequate fire safety measures and missing paperwork when inspected ([Asylum seeker HMO operator fined �60,000 for running house without licence](https://www.landlordzone.co.uk/news/asylum-seeker-hmo-operator-fined-60000-for-running-house-without-licence)).  
- **Massive Profits**: Despite regulatory issues, Clearsprings recorded **£62.5 million in post-tax profit** for 2023, a significant increase from £28 million the previous year ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **10-Year Government Contract**: Clearsprings has secured a **long-term contract until 2029**, shielding it from market fluctuations and competition ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Criticism & Public Backlash**  
- **Charities & Advocacy Groups**: Organizations like Refugee Action and the Scottish Refugee Council have condemned the excessive profits, arguing that asylum housing should not be commercialized ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  
- **Government Stance**: The Home Office justifies its actions by citing legal compliance and efforts to reduce costs by transitioning to cheaper housing alternatives ([Private Companies Profit £113m from UK Asylum Seeker Housing](https://www.naijanews.com/canada-immigration/private-companies-profit-113m-from-uk-asylum-seeker-housing/)).  

### **Conclusion**  
Both **SBHL and Clearsprings Ready Homes** are profiting substantially from asylum housing contracts, with reported concerns over **substandard living conditions, regulatory breaches, and potential conflicts of interest**. While the government continues to defend its outsourcing approach, public outcry over profiteering at the expense of asylum seekers and taxpayers is growing.",2025-03-26 09:52:16,/r/ukpolitics/comments/1jk82yx/some_facts_on_stay_belvedere_and_clear_springs/,some facts on stay belvedere and clear springs collated before february the below has been formatted and condensed for ease of reading by ai full report on stay belvedere properties sbhl clearsprings ready homes overview of their involvement both stay belvedere hotels ltd sbhl and clearsprings ready homes are private companies contracted by the uk home office to provide accommodation for asylum seekers while their operations are meant to support the governments strategy of reducing hotel dependency reports have surfaced regarding profitdriven motives substandard housing conditions and regulatory breaches stay belvedere hotels ltd sbhl profitdriven model sbhl recorded over million in net profit from its government contracts oct sep highlighting concerns about the high profitability of asylum housing at the taxpayers expense private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing political ties the company has been linked to crispin blunt mp who receives an annual fee of for advisory services raising ethical concerns private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing shifting focus sbhl aims to transition towards longerterm accommodations but details remain scarce due to contractual and legal obligations private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing clearsprings ready homes regulatory failures the company was fined for operating an unlicensed house in multiple occupation hmo in newport wales asylum seeker hmo operator fined for running house without licence it failed to comply with housing regulations including inadequate fire safety measures and missing paperwork when inspected asylum seeker hmo operator fined for running house without licence massive profits despite regulatory issues clearsprings recorded million in posttax profit for a significant increase from million the previous year private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing year government contract clearsprings has secured a longterm contract until shielding it from market fluctuations and competition private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing criticism public backlash charities advocacy groups organizations like refugee action and the scottish refugee council have condemned the excessive profits arguing that asylum housing should not be commercialized private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing government stance the home office justifies its actions by citing legal compliance and efforts to reduce costs by transitioning to cheaper housing alternatives private companies profit m from uk asylum seeker housing conclusion both sbhl and clearsprings ready homes are profiting substantially from asylum housing contracts with reported concerns over substandard living conditions regulatory breaches and potential conflicts of interest while the government continues to defend its outsourcing approach public outcry over profiteering at the expense of asylum seekers and taxpayers is growing,4,4_the_of_to_and,neutral,0.9188314080238342,neutral,0.9108061194419861
Reddit,"UK Budget – Podcast predictions vs reality - 2 weeks analysis pre/post. Hi,

I've taken a particular interest in politics over recent years, so I jump at any reason to run some analysis.

Since I spend an embarrassing amount of time building tech to analyze podcasts, I thought I'd take a look at the ""court of podcast appeal"" around the UK budget.

I found all podcast discussions with both ""Reeves"" and ""budget"" were mentioned, and then ran all of the results through an analysis pipeline.

I'l caveat and say that this might not be the most scientific study in the world. However, directionally the analysis feels directionally accurate at the very least, and also it's interesting to see all podcasts that are discussing this topic in detail (I include a full list of sources at the [bottom of the page here](https://www.podengine.ai/articles/uk-budget-oct-2024-analysis)).



# TL;DR

* Analyzed 75+ podcast episodes covering the UK Spring Budget 2024 from Oct 14, 2024, to Nov 13, 2024
* 80% of initial expert predictions about tax changes proved wrong in some way
* 72% of experts shifted their positions after the budget announcement
* **Most dramatic failure:** No tax hike prediction, despite record £40bn increase
* **Most unexpected outcome:** Employers' National Insurance increased to 15% without prior warning

# Key Concerns

* Debt and borrowing pressures on future growth
* Crowded-out private investment due to public sector overspending
* Stagnation in small and medium business (SME) employment and wages

# Detailed Analysis

# The Setup

In the weeks leading up to the Spring Budget 2024, podcast experts were confident about one thing: Rachel Reeves would not raise taxes on businesses or middle-income families. This was a central commitment in her election campaign, which promised fiscal prudence without harming small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or burdening the working class with new taxes.

>""This upcoming budget won't see taxes raised for the average worker. Rachel Reeves has been clear on this since the start of her campaign, and I don't see any room for last-minute policies that could shock voters.""  
*-- Today in Parliament, Westminster Special* (Oct 25, 2024)

Despite the certainty among these experts, what actually happened painted a very different picture.

Rachel Reeves, in an unexpected and dramatic departure from her campaign rhetoric, announced the largest post-war tax hike, including increases in employers' National Insurance, capital gains tax, and inheritance tax. The total value of tax increases amounted to £40 billion, directly affecting businesses across the UK. This fiscal shock spooked market analysts, sending the yield on 10-year gilts up by 25 basis points and reigniting bond market fears that were last seen during the disastrous Liz Truss budget.

>""Increased employer taxes during a cost-of-living crisis? This is insane. It's effectively a body blow for SMEs, with higher hiring costs forcing painful choices — layoffs or stagnation.""  
*-- Wake Up to Money* (Oct 31, 2024)

# Methodology

This analysis focused on 75+ top podcasts, including episodes from leading UK economics, political, and business podcasts. We analyzed both pre- and post-budget discussions from shows such as *Today in Parliament*, *Wake Up to Money*, *The New Statesman Podcast*, and niche financial commentary podcasts like *Macrodose* and *The Expert Factor*. Podcasts were selected based simply on the presence of them discussing the budget and Rachael Reeves, ensuring a blend of political, journalistic, and financial analysis to cover a wide range of perspectives on Reeves' first budget.

Our methodology involved:

* Searching all podcast discussions using the [Pod Engine](https://www.podengine.ai/search) search API (I created this 
* Ran each discussion found through an analysis pipeline using a few different tools ([Retool](https://retool.com/) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) were the most useful)
* Ran the same analysis pre and post budget day
* Summarized using a combination of AI and manual checks

# The Predictions That Crumbled

# 1. ""No New Taxes for Businesses""

Leading up to the 2024 Spring Budget, the overwhelming consensus across financial commentary was that Rachel Reeves would stick to her campaign promises. Almost every expert predicted no significant tax increases, especially for businesses. Yet, Reeves blindsided industries by raising employers' National Insurance contributions by 1.2 percentage points and increasing capital gains tax and inheritance tax.

>""Rachel Reeves is not going to make any hasty moves that could jeopardize business confidence. From everything we've heard on the campaign trail, she'll focus on balancing the books without imposing new burdens on employers.""  
*-- UK Politics Weekly* (Oct 27, 2024)

# Post-Budget Reality

>""Businesses are facing a squeeze like never before. Increasing employer National Insurance will stifle growth and reduce hiring. It's a colossal tax burden during a period when companies are already grappling with inflation.""  
*-- Macrodose: Special Edition* (Nov 1, 2024)

# 2. ""Minimal Taxation necessary for Fiscal Health""

Another common prediction was that Labour would use the 2024 Budget to improve public finances without shocking market movements or causing a significant realignment in business taxes. This idea stemmed from the campaign's repeated claims that Labour could fund NHS and education investment without major tax hikes through efficiency measures.

>“Expect minimal meddling with taxes—the focus will be on trimming inefficient public spending rather than taxing businesses or households.”  
*-- Times News Briefing* (Oct 26, 2024)

In contrast to these expectations, Rachel Reeves introduced one of the largest net-tax-hiking budgets in modern UK history, signaling an irreversible shift from fiscal restraint to a more heavy-handed economic intervention approach.

>""This is a surprising contradiction. We were led to believe that growth would come through careful management with subtle fiscal shifts. Instead, Reeves has rolled out tax hikes that could sink business confidence entirely.""  
*-- Wake Up to Money* (Nov 02, 2024)

# 3. ""Optimism in Economic Growth by 2026""

Several podcasts predicted that despite economic turbulence, the government's measures would set the UK on a growth trajectory by 2026. This optimism was directly tied to pre-budget leaks suggesting big promises for infrastructure investment and GDP growth driven by increased investment in public services.

>""We're going to see things recover. Inflation will subside, growth will ensue, and Reeves' strategic public spending will bring about the economic renewal Labour promises.""  
*-- The New Statesman Podcast* (Oct 25, 2024)

However, immediately following the budget release, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revised its growth forecasts downward, warning that GDP might contract in the next fiscal year and stagnate in the following two. Podcast hosts scrambled to reevaluate their earlier enthusiasm.

>""What we're looking at here is an economic gamble, and it doesn't seem like it will pay off anytime soon. GDP shortfalls, debt levels sky-high, and interest rising will freeze future growth. This is ultimately a risky move.""  
*-- One of Our Times* (Oct 31, 2024)

# Expert Opinion Evolution

The tone of pre-budget podcasts was one of cautious optimism, reflecting a consensus that Rachel Reeves would respect her campaign promises of fiscal restraint combined with targeted economic growth measures. However, this narrative quickly collapsed when the budget revealed a very different set of priorities.

# The Initial Consensus: No Major Tax Increases

Before the budget, experts were fairly aligned in believing that Reeves would promote a cautious approach, balancing fiscal challenges through minor adjustments and a “steady as she goes” economic policy rather than large-scale interventions.

>“We expect slight tax nudges, maybe an adjustment here or there for high earners, but overall this should be a minimal shift for most businesses and families.”  
*-- Political Insider, UK Special* (Oct 28, 2024)

# The Moment of Realization: Sudden Shock

As news of the Employers' National Insurance hike broke, expert predictions crumbled. Many commentators quickly backpedaled, stunned by the scale of the changes once thought impossible.

>""There's no escaping it—this is the sharpest U-turn we've seen from Labour in years. It's a dramatic reshuffling of their fiscal priorities and a real body blow to businesses.""  
*-- Times Political Cast* (October 31, 2024)

# The New Reality: Tough Decisions

The abrupt shift in policy divided many experts, with some arguing the changes were necessary but mistimed, while a majority condemned the new taxes as punitive to businesses already struggling.

>""We're going to feel pain, especially in the SME sector. This is not growth; this is survival, and the budget today makes it harder for employers to retain staff.""  
*-- Walker Cripps Macro Report* (Nov 02, 2024)

# Key Measures Analysis

To provide a more comprehensive understanding, we broke down the major budget measures as discussed across the podcasts into categories of initial support versus post-budget support. Below are the results:

|**Measure**|**Initial Support %**|**Post-Budget Support %**|**Pre-Budget Quote**|**Post-Budget Reaction**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NHS Investment (£22.6bn)|60%|50%|""This might be one of the few areas where Reeves could save face, as NHS funding must grow."" - *Newscast* (Oct 29, 2024)|""£22bn? Great headline, but NHS inefficiencies are systemic and deep. Money won't fix it now."" - *Today in Focus* (Nov 02, 2024)|
|Employers' National Insurance (+1.2% Rate)|30%|15%|""National Insurance increases seem politically infeasible—Labour has walked away already."" - *Westminster Preview* (Oct 29, 2024)|""Disastrous. This is just going to squeeze SMEs and damage job creation."" - *Wake Up to Money* (Nov 01, 2024)|
|Education Funding (£6.7bn)|65%|55%|""We can expect Labour to prioritize education promotion while balancing the budget."" - *Janet Daily* (Nov 01, 2024)|""Spending is up, but cash alone won't reform schools."" - *Times Weekly* (Nov 02, 2024)|

# Hidden Patterns

There were key overlooked elements in the 2024 Spring Budget that subtly shaped broader responses from experts, which emerged clearly in our analysis of podcasts.

# 1. Preemptive Leaks as Market Stabilization

>""There's been a substantial move towards transparency. Rachel Reeves has made efforts beyond what any prior Chancellor has done, particularly in pre-disclosing her fiscal changes to avoid market panic.""  
*-- Newscast, October Budget Breakdown*

The slew of pre-budget leaks, orchestrated by Reeves, initially aimed to calm markets by avoiding any ""Truss-style"" meltdowns. On closer inspection, several podcast hosts pointed out this early media saturation alleviated much of the shock that might have been more impactful during the official release.

However, as *Politics at Jack & Sam's* explained, these early leaks suggested substantial internal uncertainty within Labour about how the market would react, and many suspect the leaks telegraphed larger internal doubts about the business tax increases, which Reeves later committed to fully.

This shift in communication strategy, while blunting immediate reactions, also served to reduce broader economic trust in future Labour disclosures due to its clear attempts to adjust psychic harm caused by fiscal realities.

# 2. Crowding Out the Private Sector

One of the more subtle yet damaging fiscal shifts discussed was the crowding out of private investment due to the scale of public sector investment in the 2024 Budget. After the announcement, bond markets reacted negatively, with 10-year gilts rising by 25 basis points, a move described by *Walker Cripps Market Analysis* as indicative of investors fleeing UK debt.

>""Reeves' public sector push will throttle capital availability in the long-term, limiting long-term innovation and growth for UK businesses.""  
*-- Macrodose Economic Byte* (Nov 2, 2024)

# Technical Insights Made Simple

One of the most glaring financial risks highlighted across the podcasts was Rachel Reeves' use of asset sales and government-held equity as collateral to mitigate debt.

>""Collateralizing public assets to cover the deficit is more than a fiscal gimmick—it's a thinly-veiled method to make debt sustainability look better on paper, while potentially destabilizing markets in the event of asset underperformance.""  
*-- Political Currency, Post-Budget Review* (Nov 03, 2024)

By relying on public asset sales in future budgets, Reeves may have created short-term fiscal maneuvers but at the expense of long-term sustainability. This move, while largely ignored by many early pre-budget analyses, demonstrated a technical risk whereby fluctuating asset markets could contribute to future financial collapses during downturn cycles.

# Future Implications

As post-budget episodes emerged, experts shifted focus towards long-term consequences beyond 2024.

# 1. The Wage Conundrum

Initially hailed as a pro-worker budget due to minimum wage increases, further commentary revealed an ugly truth—wage growth might stagnate from 2025 onward, particularly for private sector employees.

>""Private-sector real wages may thin out, compounded by employer taxes and higher inflation. Any immediate increases could give way to stagflation in 2 years.""  
*-- Walker Bricks, November Mid-Cycle Financial Report*

# 2. Debt and Growth Plateau by 2030

Several experts on shows like *Bloomberg UK Market Digest* highlighted an ominous trend embedded in the OBR's projections—while Labour aims for mid-decade growth, the long-term forecasts suggest stagnation by 2030, as debt accrual limits GDP growth beyond that point.

>""The aura wears off fast—by 2029, borrowing costs and rising tax burdens create stagnation in capital markets, leading inevitably to a post-2030 growth plateau.""  
*-- Bloomberg UK Market Weekly* (Nov 02, 2024)

# Conclusion

Rachel Reeves' 2024 Spring Budget defied the confident predictions of podcast experts across the UK financial and political ecosystem. **80%** of initial predictions regarding tax rates, fiscal measures, and business implications ultimately missed the mark, forcing major post-budget re-evaluations. From increases in the Employers' National Insurance to the vicious crowding out of private sector funds, this budget has largely reset expectations for the UK's economy going forward—revealing the complex balance Reeves must now strike between paying for public services and spurring private-sector growth.

While long-term gains remain theoretically possible, current expert sentiment is cautious, with major concerns about debt sustainability, limited SME growth, and weak future GDP performance. Time will tell if Reeves' gambles will pay off, but for now, experts are left questioning far more than they had three weeks prior.

or middleincome families this was a central commitment in her election campaign which promised fiscal prudence without harming small and mediumsized enterprises smes or burdening the working class with new taxes this upcoming budget wont see taxes raised for the average worker rachel reeves has been clear on this since the start of her campaign and i dont see any room for lastminute policies that could shock voters today in parliament westminster special oct despite the certainty among these experts what actually happened painted a very different picture rachel reeves in an unexpected and dramatic departure from her campaign rhetoric announced the largest postwar tax hike including increases in employers national insurance capital gains tax and inheritance tax the total value of tax increases amounted to billion directly affecting businesses across the uk this fiscal shock spooked market analysts sending the yield on year gilts up by basis points and reigniting bond market fears that were last seen during the disastrous liz truss budget increased employer taxes during a costofliving crisis this is insane its effectively a body blow for smes with higher hiring costs forcing painful choices layoffs or stagnation wake up to money oct methodology this analysis focused on top podcasts including episodes from leading uk economics political and business podcasts we analyzed both pre and postbudget discussions from shows such as today in parliament wake up to money the new statesman podcast and niche financial commentary podcasts like macrodose and the expert factor podcasts were selected based simply on the presence of them discussing the budget and rachael reeves ensuring a blend of political journalistic and financial analysis to cover a wide range of perspectives on reeves first budget our methodology involved searching all podcast discussions using the pod engine search api i created this ran each discussion found through an analysis pipeline using a few different tools retool and claude were the most useful ran the same analysis pre and post budget day summarized using a combination of ai and manual checks the predictions that crumbled no new taxes for businesses leading up to the spring budget the overwhelming consensus across financial commentary was that rachel reeves would stick to her campaign promises almost every expert predicted no significant tax increases especially for businesses yet reeves blindsided industries by raising employers national insurance contributions by percentage points and increasing capital gains tax and inheritance tax rachel reeves is not going to make any hasty moves that could jeopardize business confidence from everything weve heard on the campaign trail shell focus on balancing the books without imposing new burdens on employers uk politics weekly oct postbudget reality businesses are facing a squeeze like never before increasing employer national insurance will stifle growth and reduce hiring its a colossal tax burden during a period when companies are already grappling with inflation macrodose special edition nov minimal taxation necessary for fiscal health another common prediction was that labour would use the budget to improve public finances without shocking market movements or causing a significant realignment in business taxes this idea stemmed from the campaigns repeated claims that labour could fund nhs and education investment without major tax hikes through efficiency measures expect minimal meddling with taxesthe focus will be on trimming inefficient public spending rather than taxing businesses or households times news briefing oct in contrast to these expectations rachel reeves introduced one of the largest nettaxhiking budgets in modern uk history signaling an irreversible shift from fiscal restraint to a more heavyhanded economic intervention approach this is a surprising contradiction we were led to believe that growth would come through careful management with subtle fiscal shifts instead reeves has rolled out tax hikes that could sink business confidence entirely wake up to money nov optimism in economic growth by several podcasts predicted that despite economic turbulence the governments measures would set the uk on a growth trajectory by this optimism was directly tied to prebudget leaks suggesting big promises for infrastructure investment and gdp growth driven by increased investment in public services were going to see things recover inflation will subside growth will ensue and reeves strategic public spending will bring about the economic renewal labour promises the new statesman podcast oct however immediately following the budget release the office for budget responsibility obr revised its growth forecasts downward warning that gdp might contract in the next fiscal year and stagnate in the following two podcast hosts scrambled to reevaluate their earlier enthusiasm what were looking at here is an economic gamble and it doesnt seem like it will pay off anytime soon gdp shortfalls debt levels skyhigh and interest rising will freeze future growth this is ultimately a risky move one of our times oct expert opinion evolution the tone of prebudget podcasts was one of cautious optimism reflecting a consensus that rachel reeves would respect her campaign promises of fiscal restraint combined with targeted economic growth measures however this narrative quickly collapsed when the budget revealed a very different set of priorities the initial consensus no major tax increases before the budget experts were fairly aligned in believing that reeves would promote a cautious approach balancing fiscal challenges through minor adjustments and a steady as she goes economic policy rather than largescale interventions we expect slight tax nudges maybe an adjustment here or there for high earners but overall this should be a minimal shift for most businesses and families political insider uk special oct the moment of realization sudden shock as news of the employers national insurance hike broke expert predictions crumbled many commentators quickly backpedaled stunned by the scale of the changes once thought impossible theres no escaping itthis is the sharpest uturn weve seen from labour in years its a dramatic reshuffling of their fiscal priorities and a real body blow to businesses times political cast october the new reality tough decisions the abrupt shift in policy divided many experts with some arguing the changes were necessary but mistimed while a majority

Reddit,"Keir Starmer’s speech to Progressive Britain Conference 13/05/2023 – “Country First” - Aka the ""I don't care if people think I'm a conservative"" speech.. Thank you conference. It’s always great to be here with you at Congress House – the real progressive alliance!



The heartbeat of a movement that is winning, where we need to win, where we haven’t won for decades - in all four corners of England.



In Blackpool, Middlesbrough, Dover, Medway, Plymouth, Swindon, Stoke-on-Trent.

 

Once again: the largest party in local government.

 

All of which, I’m reliably told, means the real winner last week was Rishi Sunak. A brilliant strategy – a masterstroke – to lose 1000 seats!

 

Honestly, even by Westminster standards – the spin last week was quite something. But all that noise, it’s water off a duck's back. It will never distract me from our ultimate goal.

 

Do you know – when I was a kid, I was a decent middle distance runner, racing across Surrey in the late 1970s. Not actually where, you might think, a breeding ground for progressive politics…

 

But one thing any runner will tell you is the hardest yards always come at the end. So make no mistake – we are on track. We are on a path towards power.

 

But there’s still more work to be done, a lot more work, and the toughest part lies ahead.

 

We’ve got to show, not just reassurance, not just that we’re better than the Tories - last week’s result show people already get that.

 

The task now is to measure up to the scale of change that Britain needs, demonstrate that we can be the hope working people need, get our purpose, our pride, our future – back.

 

Restoring hope for working people - it’s a simple aim. But it’s what we’ve got to be about.  

 

A politics that uses power to fix problems, not protest to grab the limelight. This is my project. Respect - my guide. Unlocking aspiration – my cause.

 

And the goal is a Labour Party that speaks for, fights for and wins for working people.

 

But it won’t be easy. We’ve got to navigate our way through revolutions in technology, in energy, in medicine and, with an ageing society, even in who we are.

 

Climate change is a recipe for global instability. The global economy, the power in the world, is changing. There is war on our continent.

 

And then there’s the state of our country after thirteen years of shambolic Tory government.

 

Seriously, if you think our job in 1997 was to rebuild a crumbling public realm, that in 1964 it was to modernise an economy overly dependent on the kindness of strangers.

 

In 1945 - to build a new Britain, in a volatile world, out of the trauma of collective sacrifice.

 

Well, in 2024 it will have to be all three.

 

And at a time when our politics feels broken, when people are bruised by the past thirteen years; where working people listened to politicians who said “we’re all in together” – but who made them pay for the mess caused by the banks.  

 

Where they missed funerals, weddings, last goodbyes, all to save the lives of people they will never meet, while the Government broke all the rules that they followed.

 

And when – as their bills, their mortgages, their rent all went up, they were told there’s no more money for you, but there is for the richest 1%. And by the way, you need to accept that your family is going to be poorer.

 

Conference – this is the territory of decline. The stony ground where our project must plant its roots. The soil where we must grow our hope.

 

It’s no wonder working people don’t trust politicians, after all they’ve been through, no wonder lots of people now think things ‘can only get worse’.

 

We’ve got to turn that around – absolutely. But that’s why our project can’t be surface level, can’t be skin deep.

 

It all boils down to this: the Labour Party will only restore hope in the country, if we once again become the natural vehicle for working people, an agent for their hopes and aspirations, and a party of the common good.  

 

Some people think that all we’re doing is distancing ourselves from the previous regime. We are - but that misses the point.

 

This is about taking our party back to where we belong and where we should always have been, back doing what we were created to do.

 

We’ve been drifting away from working people for a long time – and that’s unforgivable.

That’s why I say this project goes further and deeper than New Labour’s rewriting of clause 4.

 

This is about rolling up our sleeves, changing our entire culture.

 

It’s our DNA:

 

Who we are in it for?

Who do we serve?

Who do we wake up in the morning and fight for?

Who do we have in our mind’s eye when we make decisions?

 

And with the levels of cynicism in our politics, the let-down, the drifting away, the disconnect: our collapse in Scotland, the loss of the red wall. This task is ongoing, difficult and enormous.

 

It is, if you like, Clause Four – on steroids. And the results last week show our work is beginning to pay off.

 

But look, it’s much easier to lose the trust of working people; far harder to reconnect.

 

It’s not just that the problems – cost-of-living, the NHS, climate change – will take some time to fix, of course they will.

 

We’ve also got to understand how a world of change – those three revolutions - are producing levels of insecurity that are hard to endure.

 

That if work doesn’t pay, if living standards are falling, bills are rising, holidays start to feel out of reach, family life does feel more fragile.

 

That when you look out of your window and you see your community changing, your high street boarded up, fly-tipping, anti-social behaviour, drugs, and crime.

 

That does gnaw away at your confidence in the future, that if you see an economy which hoards power and potential - where the South East creates the wealth and the only answer that’s offered is redistribution - that doesn’t treat our communities with the dignity or respect that they deserve.  

 

And most of all that patriotism is about putting the country first, about serving your country, not just parading its symbols like the Tories do, but that working people do need to see your commitment to service.

 

Not some kind of patronising contempt for those who fly our flag.

 

It’s a project that comes from my values, from my political core, that depends on understanding the true worth of service, respect and stability, and gets how these three values are the precondition for hope and unity, for reconnecting with working people and meeting their aspirations in a more volatile world.

 

Service – because it is the lifeblood of unity, of collective mission.

 

People think politics is about vanity or self-enrichment. We’ve got to show them the country always comes first.

 

That’s why we had to change our party.

 

Show we want business to prosper.

 

That our support for NATO is non-negotiable.

 

That we’ll rip anti-Semitism out by its roots.

 

Country first, party second.

 

Respect - because people want a politics that is done with them, not to them. That is about lifting people up, not punching down.

 

I have never believed there was an appetite for culture war politics in this country. You don’t need to humiliate people to move your country forward – you need to bring people together:

 

Business and worker, public and private, politics and people.

 

Four great nations all pulling together, all united in a collective mission - a mission with priorities that are contested, debated, negotiated, of course -

but where politics has a higher purpose that we never compromise on.

 

Where we understand that a nation is not just a country, but a community. Not just a collection of individuals, but a cause. And from that, that we all owe things to one another.  

 

Like dignity, understanding, and most of all, respect.

 

This is everything to me – I saw how feelings of disrespect weighed my father down and chipped away at his esteem. I want Britain to be a country where people don’t have to change who they are, just to get on.

 

Whatever your circumstances, however you contribute, whoever you are, everyone deserves respect.

 

That’s not just a moral imperative. I also believe it’s a force far more powerful than division.

 

Because when people are fully respected, when they feel their contribution carries weight, that they are able to bring their whole self to their work, their shoulders lift up. Their belief comes back.

 

Hope is restored.

 

And then you put that alongside the natural ambition people have for their town, their community, their family.

 

A pride and a purpose I’ve seen in spades these past five weeks.  

 

Then yes – we can build a better Britain. We can provide the secure foundations working people need and get our future back.

 

But those two words – secure foundations - they tell us that the third ingredient of hope is stability.

 

It’s always been a crucial part of the Labour promise.

 

Secure jobs.

 

Affordable housing.

 

A safety net in hard times.

 

A foundation working people can trust, rely on, draw upon for their aspiration, their hopes, the better future that they want for their children.

 

But I’ve got to be honest – I don’t think the language of stability comes naturally to progressive politics.

 

I think too often we dismiss it as conservative, as a barrier to change.

 

Don’t mistake me – the very best of progressive politics is found in our determination to push Britain forward.

 

A hunger, an ambition, that we can seize the opportunities of tomorrow and make them work for working people.

 

**But this ambition must never become unmoored from working peoples’ need for stability, for order, security.**

 

**We must understand that there are precious things – in our way of life, in our environment, in our communities – that it is our responsibility to protect and preserve, to pass on to future generations.**

 

**If that sounds conservative, then let me tell you: I don’t care.**

 

**Somebody has got to stand up for the things that make this country great and it isn’t going to be the Tories.**

 

**That in the end is one of the great failures of the last 13 years.
**
 

**A Tory Party that in generations past saw itself as the protector of the nation and the union has undermined both.
**
 

**Has taken an axe to the security of family life.**

 

**Has trashed Britain’s reputation abroad.**

 

**Has totally lost touch with the ordinary hope of working people.**

 

**The Conservative Party can no longer claim to be conservative.**

 

**It conserves nothing of value – not our rivers and seas, not our NHS or BBC, not our families, not our nation.**

 

**But the lesson for progressives must be that if a tide of change threatens to sweep away the stability working people need, we have to be in there - fighting for security just as fervently as we fight against injustice.**

 

**It’s not our job to lecture working people that change is coming – it’s our job to lead them through it. To bring people together and chart a new course. To use the power of government to help, support, protect and lift up.**

 

To stand, as in times past, with working people, pushing Britain forward, in search of their ordinary hope.

 

That’s what this project has always been about. We’ve got to keep showing those values.

 

Show that service, respect and stability are central to our approach.

 

Demonstrate how a changed party can change the country.

 

That was the success of ‘New Labour, New Britain’ - a modernised party fit to modernise the country.

 

That is our approach today – a party once again on the side of working people; changing Britain to govern for working people.

 

Because if we keep to those values, understand how important they are to hope, and put them alongside the fundamental progressive argument that we will use the power of dynamic government to push this country forward, then have no doubt – this is a Labour moment.

 

Conference, that’s what the future demands. Alongside dynamic government, you need that sense of collective purpose.

 

It’s essential for our five missions, for everything we want to achieve in government.

 

It’s how we make our streets safe.

 

Tear down barriers to opportunity.

 

Become a clean energy superpower.

 

Build an NHS fit for the future.

 

And push our country forward to the highest sustained growth in the G7.

 

And not just any old growth. Growth that truly serves working people, that understands the need for stability, raises living standards everywhere, comes from the grassroots.  

 

Growth that focuses on productivity in every community, not just redistribution.

 

That sees secure, well-paid jobs as the litmus test for our politics, and puts communities in charge of their own destiny.

 

A new course; a break not just from Labour arguments of the past, but also from the traditional Westminster model.

 

This is what I mean by mission-led government.

 

And it’s why I’m not afraid to use the language of take back control.

 

There’s no hope in these times for a stand-aside state. But at the same time nobody is going to unite behind the traditional Westminster way of doing things.

 

Seriously - walk round any working class community and you will be hit over the head by this. The people we need to serve no longer have faith in an unreformed state.

 

And that speaks to the bigger truth - that the British people want a politics that gets the value of respect and service.

 

Want stability and change.

 

Security and hope.

 

That is why I’m here. That is my project. A new partnership between politics and working people.

 

A new Labour project for our times.

 

A changed Labour Party for a changed Britain…

 

Labour - back as the party of working people.

 

That is our approach.

 

That’s what we’re going to deliver.

 

That’s how we get our future back.

on a path towards power but theres still more work to be done a lot more work and the toughest part lies ahead weve got to show not just reassurance not just that were better than the tories last weeks result show people already get that the task now is to measure up to the scale of change that britain needs demonstrate that we can be the hope working people need get our purpose our pride our future back restoring hope for working people its a simple aim but its what weve got to be about a politics that uses power to fix problems not protest to grab the limelight this is my project respect my guide unlocking aspiration my cause and the goal is a labour party that speaks for fights for and wins for working people but it wont be easy weve got to navigate our way through revolutions in technology in energy in medicine and with an ageing society even in who we are climate change is a recipe for global instability the global economy the power in the world is changing there is war on our continent and then theres the state of our country after thirteen years of shambolic tory government seriously if you think our job in was to rebuild a crumbling public realm that in it was to modernise an economy overly dependent on the kindness of strangers in to build a new britain in a volatile world out of the trauma of collective sacrifice well in it will have to be all three and at a time when our politics feels broken when people are bruised by the past thirteen years where working people listened to politicians who said were all in together but who made them pay for the mess caused by the banks where they missed funerals weddings last goodbyes all to save the lives of people they will never meet while the government broke all the rules that they followed and when as their bills their mortgages their rent all went up they were told theres no more money for you but there is for the richest and by the way you need to accept that your family is going to be poorer conference this is the territory of decline the stony ground where our project must plant its roots the soil where we must grow our hope its no wonder working people dont trust politicians after all theyve been through no wonder lots of people now think things can only get worse weve got to turn that around absolutely but thats why our project cant be surface level cant be skin deep it all boils down to this the labour party will only restore hope in the country if we once again become the natural vehicle for working people an agent for their hopes and aspirations and a party of the common good some people think that all were doing is distancing ourselves from the previous regime we are but that misses the point this is about taking our party back to where we belong and where we should always have been back doing what we were created to do weve been drifting away from working people for a long time and thats unforgivable thats why i say this project goes further and deeper than new labours rewriting of clause this is about rolling up our sleeves changing our entire culture its our dna who we are in it for who do we serve who do we wake up in the morning and fight for who do we have in our minds eye when we make decisions and with the levels of cynicism in our politics the letdown the drifting away the disconnect our collapse in scotland the loss of the red wall this task is ongoing difficult and enormous it is if you like clause four on steroids and the results last week show our work is beginning to pay off but look its much easier to lose the trust of working people far harder to reconnect its not just that the problems costofliving the nhs climate change will take some time to fix of course they will weve also got to understand how a world of change those three revolutions are producing levels of insecurity that are hard to endure that if work doesnt pay if living standards are falling bills are rising holidays start to feel out of reach family life does feel more fragile that when you look out of your window and you see your community changing your high street boarded up flytipping antisocial behaviour drugs and crime that does gnaw away at your confidence in the future that if you see an economy which hoards power and potential where the south east creates the wealth and the only answer thats offered is redistribution that doesnt treat our communities with the dignity or respect that they deserve and most of all that patriotism is about putting the country first about serving your country not just parading its symbols like the tories do but that working people do need to see your commitment to service not some kind of patronising contempt for those who fly our flag its a project that comes from my values from my political core that depends on understanding the true worth of service respect and stability and gets how these three values are the precondition for hope and unity for reconnecting with working people and meeting their aspirations in a more volatile world service because it is the lifeblood of unity of collective mission people think politics is about vanity or selfenrichment weve got to show them the country always comes first thats why we had to change our party show we want business to prosper that our support for nato is nonnegotiable that well rip antisemitism out by its roots country first party second respect because people want a politics that is done with them not to them that is about lifting people up not punching down i have never believed there was an appetite for culture war politics in this country you dont need to humiliate people to move your country forward you need to bring people together business and worker public and private politics and people four great nations all pulling together all united in a collective mission a mission with priorities that are contested debated negotiated of course but where politics has a higher purpose that we never compromise on where we understand that a nation is not just a country but a community not just a collection of individuals but a cause and from that that we all owe things to one another like dignity understanding and most of all respect this is everything to me i saw how feelings of disrespect weighed my father down and chipped away at his esteem i want britain to be a country where people dont have to change who they are just to get on whatever your circumstances however you contribute whoever you are everyone deserves respect thats not just a moral imperative i also believe its a force far more powerful than division because when people are fully respected when they feel their contribution carries weight that they are able to bring their whole self to their work their shoulders lift up their belief comes back hope is restored and then you put that alongside the natural ambition people have for their town their community their family a pride and a purpose ive seen in spades these past five weeks then yes we can build a better britain we can provide the secure foundations working people need and get our future back but those two words secure foundations they tell us that the third ingredient of hope is stability its always been a crucial part of the labour promise secure jobs affordable housing a safety net in hard times a foundation working people can trust rely on draw upon for their aspiration their hopes the better future that they want for their children but ive got to be honest i dont think the language of stability comes naturally to progressive politics i think too often we dismiss it as conservative as a barrier to change dont mistake me the very best of progressive politics is found in our determination to push britain forward a hunger an ambition that we can seize the opportunities of tomorrow and make them work for working people but this ambition must never become unmoored from working peoples need for stability for order security we must understand that there are precious things in our way of life in our environment in our communities that it is our responsibility to protect and preserve to pass on to future generations if that sounds conservative then let me tell you i dont care somebody has got to stand up for the things that make this country great and it isnt going to be the tories that in the end is one of the great failures of the last years a tory party that in generations past saw itself as the protector of the nation and the union has undermined both has taken an axe to the security of family life has trashed britains reputation abroad has totally lost touch with the ordinary hope of working people the conservative party can no longer claim to be conservative it conserves nothing of value not our rivers and seas not our nhs or bbc not our families not our nation but the lesson for progressives must be that if a tide of change threatens to sweep away the stability working people need we have to be in there fighting for security just as fervently as we fight against injustice its not our job to lecture working people that change is coming its our job to lead them through it to bring people together and chart a new course to use the power of government to help support protect and lift up to stand as in times past with working people pushing britain forward in search of their ordinary hope thats what this project has always been about weve got to keep showing those values show that service respect and stability are central to our approach demonstrate how a changed party can change the country that was the success of new labour new britain a modernised party fit to modernise the country that is our approach today a party once again on the side of working people changing britain to govern for working people because if we keep to those values understand how important they are to hope and put them alongside the fundamental progressive argument that we will use the power of dynamic government to push this country forward then have no doubt this is a labour moment conference thats what the future demands alongside dynamic government you need that sense of collective purpose its essential for our five missions for everything we want to achieve in government its how we make our streets safe tear down barriers to opportunity become a clean energy superpower build an nhs fit for the future and push our country forward to the highest sustained growth in the g and not just any old growth growth that truly serves working people that understands the need for stability raises living standards everywhere comes from the grassroots growth that focuses on productivity in every community not just redistribution that sees secure wellpaid jobs as the litmus test for our politics and puts communities in charge of their own destiny a new course a break not just from labour arguments of the past but also from the traditional westminster model this is what i mean by missionled government and its why im not afraid to use the language of take back control theres no hope in these times for a standaside state but at the same time nobody is going to unite behind the traditional westminster way of doing things seriously walk round any working class community and you will be hit over the head by this the people we need to serve no longer have faith in an unreformed state and that speaks to the bigger truth that the british people want a politics that gets the value of respect and service want stability and change security and hope that is why im here that is my project a new partnership between politics and working people a new labour project for our times a changed labour party for a changed britain labour back as the party of working people that is our approach thats what were going to deliver thats how we get our future back thank you,4,4_the_of_to_and,positive,0.9041160941123962,admiration,0.5690890550613403

## ** Trigger Warning for**
### grooming, self harm, negligent parents

I have gave a trigger warning just in case.

——————- 

It’s like China and 1984 had a baby this new law to verify you’re an adult in the UK. 

So many are saying how ridiculous it is and how it ultimately will not protec children.

A TikToker put it the best:

It’s not about protecting children because this generation knows more about Technology than their parents and the dinosaurs who make these decisions.

A preteen could easily work out how to bypass this but a 60 year old man would need help with getting an age verification.

It’s to control what we view as fully grown adults and that’s the crux of it. 

Who has the right to tell me what I’m allowed to view online? Unless it’s something outright illegal like child open then I should be allowed to watch open or footage of war zones or whatever else I want to.

But here is the really scary thing they are doing: by verifying ourselves.

There are three forms of doing this and they allbreath personal privacy - aren’t we told NOT to give our bank information to people we don’t know and trust? For me the government is under that category.

So you share your bank information which is likely stored somewhere and therefore can be accessed by hackers and STOLEN or CLONED. 

Next is your passport and again if this is breached you have the same issues as with the bank. 

Then you have facial recognition which is both stupid and dangerous because:
- What if someone looks much younger than they are? I’ll tell you now when I was 21 I did not look 21. Hell when I was 30 a doctor said it was nice that I was bringing my little sister to her appointment (daughter was 6). So what happens then if you don’t have a passport (I don’t and just waiting for one to arrive as it’s been so expensive to travel abroad I didn’t bother renewing) then what? 
- Onthe opposite side what if you DO look older than your age? Some 15/16 year olds look much older than their age. My friend at school was very tall, long eyelashes, defined cheek bones etc. I knew her from 12-14 mind you but I have no doubt at 15/16 she’d have bypassed this feature and then it makes the reason for the law null and void.
- Like the two above what if these photos are stored? Someone else could use your face to be able to access certain websites and even worse if you have someone’s face you have the unlikely but still scary prospect of deep fakes. Hacker gets your facial identification and tracks what websites you’ve used. Then they find out your email address because you subscribed to offers, newsletter etc. now hacker emails you with a demand— $1000 or explicit phones or videos of you are going to be published online. But unlike with most of these bluff scams they have your face and they can superimpose them on another body, you ignored because you don’t give in to blackmail and they post it now your parents, partner and that creepy person who fancied you in school and still stalks your socials has seen it. How can you prove it’s not you? Only way to do this is once the police get involved as they have special technology that can notice slight discrepancies in fake vs real photos/videos but then damage is done. Or you give in and send it then they demand more because, they always do.

I’m not saying these situations are going to be commonplace but I’m saying it’s going to make identity theft, revenge porn and fraud much, much easier if you know how to go about it and let’s face it if it happens to 5 people out of millions that’s 5 that could’ve been prevented.

But ignoring all the above like I’ve said it’s invading privacy - we have a right to privacy online unless there’s an indication we are conducting illegal activity or looking for it.

Instead why don’t we:
- Ramp up the online safety classes in schools. They are much better as my 12 and 9 year old child have had them. Let’s get into more detail though don’t be afraid to gloss over uncomfortable topics. I’d maybe even have them have a test at the end of each year with up to date information, tactics, apps to look out for etc so they are always aware. This isn’t to scare them as if they ignore msssges from strangers then they can safely be on the internet.
- Likewise parents having these conversations. You can’t guarantee a parent will as not every parent actually monitors their kid properly which is why we need schools to do it as well. My 12 year old felt very awkward but I sat her down and told her what an online predator was, what kind of tactics they might. Use and what to do if she thinks she’s being targeted by one. She said she knew all this but I wasn’t taking that chance as as her mother it’s my duty to make her aware and safe - you can’t stop all the predators but you can ensure your child is not victim to one. I also told her to advise a friend these things if they felt they were being targeted and to tell me if this happens as to me it’s a duty to protect her friends and peers as best as I can and I would take action. 
- In later years in school have a police officer who deals with predators and / or an ex victim of a predator come to give a talk. Hearing it from real people who have this as their life would quite honestly make it a more personable thing.
- It’s not just predators that both parents and schools should be educating their children on. Yes it’s a difficult conversation to have but how damaging porn can be to the young brain and how it effects there views of sex and future relationships should be covered, the damage and effects of violent or disturbing content on the internet can have and how it leads to desensitisation, groups that may target young people and what their tactics and beliefs are and how toxic they can be for them - I’m thinking radicalisation, racist groups, incels. 
- Have your child in the same room as you or if they are in a separate room and if only do this as teen and above with adequate knowledge from what’s stated above - they need to keep the door open. I won’t get into detail but my parents did not supervise my internet access and I’d be alone in my bedroom. With a webcam aged 10 plus. Like I’ve said no details need to be given here but needless to say I have some trauma from some experiences I had.
- Check your children’s phones and tablets. I know I mentioned that the government is invading our privacy and that’s not acceptable but when you have especially young children who have social media, WhatsApp etc I’m sorry but you need to check this. Not just for grooming but for potential bullying ants over things. I do it on my 12 year olds phone every 7-14 days. I have seen messages for example where her friend has self harmed and I’ve told her that an adult  needs to know as well as being shown these things at her age are highly disturbing especially as this friend has said if something doesn’t go her way she’d. sH and a child needs to know it’s not their job to give into not placate someone who does this - if you learn this as a child this will carry on to adulthood where hopefully you’ll see that this kind of behaviour isn’t okay to make someone do what you want and you do not need to give in. Instead tell an adult if a child or their family or friends if an adult and genuinely think it might happen or if a child and parents aren’t a safe place then  I’ll tell the school or social services as that’s my job as a parent. If an adult and can’t contact friends or family get a welfare check called out on them.

I’m going to end it here and I’m sorry it’s been incredibly long I just think it’s important to say all this and look at what could’ve been done instead of these measures.

I hope you and any children you have stay safe 🌹 ",2025-08-07 14:09:22,/r/ukpolitics/comments/1mk13pj/uk_internet_censorship_why_its_bad_and_what/,uk internet censorship why its bad and what wouldve

Today we're announcing some rule changes and notices for the subreddit now that the dust has had a chance to settle after the GE.

We wanted to make rules easier to read and understand, reducing any room for misinterpretation by users. Most of what follows is explanatory and does not represent significant changes in rules. 

I, Optio, want to apologise to the community because we've been fairly tardy with getting this material together. Users have been asked to expect this rules update announcement lots of times with the deadline being extended by roughly one week, each week, since the new year. 
To combat this, in future we'll be moving to something like a monthly or six-weekly ""state of the union"" type post where we'll roll such details into the next update with the intention of making it a continuous improvement rather than staccato like change.

We welcome your constructive comments and will listen to them as we make changes to the rules in the future.

## DISINGENUOUS COMMENTS

A while ago, we removed references to ""bad faith"" from the rules, specifically rule 1 and 19c. The reason for doing so is simply that people have been continuously reporting things as ""bad faith"" and citing rule 1 simply because someone has commented or posted things they disagree with.We haven't touched references to ""uncivil, abusive, or antagonistic behaviour"" and anything that is truly ""bad faith"" will fall under one of these categories.

---
## CONTEST MODE DURATION

Some users have asked about contest mode. We said we'd try lowering it once into the post-election period, so we’ve now reduced it to 30 minutes. We kindly ask that you follow reddiquette guidelines on up and downvoting. Please don't use it as a way of agreeing or disagreeing, please use it as a way of highlighting interesting or insightful comments.

-----

## LOW EFFORT SATIRE & ANTAGONISM

Low effort trolling was a significant problem during the election and has continued after - although it seems to be different groups of people in some cases. There will always be some element of this, however we will continue to stamp down on it when it's blatant and disruptive. ***Sarcasm and mockery of political developments (but not users)*** remain fine. There are no changes to the rules or moderation here. 

Antagonistic or dishonest complaints about moderation are unacceptable too and we will tighten up on these. We dont mind some constructive criticism or ""hey, you guys need to take some time and figure out this problem"" is fine; insults, abuse or disparaging remarks about the presumed views of the mods are not. See the ""Expectation Management"" section.

-----

## DAILY MEGATHREADS

Going forward, we plan to have a daily post running everyday to catch hot takes (including reactionary tweets) and house general discussion about politics that doesn't fit into other posts. This should happen automatically.

-----

## EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT

One thing that we do feel needs to be clarified is that this is an amateur moderator team operating casually to run a subreddit for fun. We are not willing to operate high levels of moderation and the moderation team that would require. The expectation is to retain roughly the same size of moderation team pre-election. 

Our expectation is that the subreddit will never be as busy as it has been in recent times with the unprecedented levels of political spectacle. We believe the moderation team size we have operated is sufficient for the level of moderation we want to deliver, and operating a larger team would bring in considerable difficulties in consistency and activity management.

We will review subreddit and mod activity levels and take on new mods as and when needed. After their sterling work with Megathreads between October and the New Year (including the GE) offers were made to /u/Jaydenkieran and /u/carrot-carrot. Jayden accepted his offer and has been a mod for some time now. We have also now taken on /u/itried2.

-----

## LIGHT TOUCH MODERATION
 
We operate light touch moderation. This means we try to only moderate when it becomes necessary for smooth running of the subreddit. We're not interested in being the arbiter of who is right in a slapfight many comments deep. Expect robust discussions and debate. 

Despite the intention to be light touch we still conduct thousands of moderation actions. You won’t see when we ban someone and won’t see comments we’ve removed, please don’t assume it’s not happening. 

We give you, the users, a lot of room to maneouvre on the topic and quality of discussion; with the expectation that you appreciate that room and give it its due respect. 

To our disappointment, of late this has not been happening on difficult issues like discussions about Labour's Trans policy (or Trans issues in general)  where a lot of the discussion seems to little more than a smokescreen or vehicle for an opportunity to pour venom on the subject.  

We expect users to treat such subjects with a bit of gravity and respect; and where this is not happening users should expect their comments to be removed. 

-----

## RULE CHANGE DETAILS

We’ve divided the rules to have a set of ""technical"" rules, such as how you should post a specific thing (like a Twitter comment chain), and ""conduct"" rules, which is an indication of how we'll moderate content. You will see the new list replace our current rules. The rules haven’t changed except as below. 

## Technical rule changes

* Rule 4a (removing old news articles) will now have a guideline of 28 rather than 7 days before an article is deemed too old.
* Rule 8 will have an added clarification that users submitting their own content should already be contributing to the sub. This has always been an unwritten guideline, but wasn’t expressly noted here.

## Conduct rule changes

* We have removed references to “bad faith” from rules 1 and 19c. Behaviour that is uncivil, abusive, or antagonistic will still be removed.

## Process changes

* ""State of the Subreddit"" type posts to occur on a regular (but not timetabled) basis, at least one every six weeks.",2020-02-19

Reddit,"The demise of the Baby Boomers will change Britain forever. The demise of the Baby Boomers will change Britain forever

Children of Baby Boomers are due to inherit £1.2 trillion from their parents, making society more unequal than ever before

Right now it’s open season on the Baby Boomers. Left-wing millennials seem to blame the postwar generation – most of whom are now pensioners – for everything from wealth inequality to the shortage of affordable housing. Indignantly they quote claims that the average pensioner now has a higher income than the average worker, that pensioners control around 80 per cent of this country’s private wealth, and that one in five pensioners is a millionaire. In their fury, however, these millennials are forgetting a small but significant fact.

Which is that Baby Boomers are not immortal.

As a result, over the next 20-30 years this country is going to experience a phenomenon that experts are calling “the Great Wealth Transfer”. According to one estimate, the children of the Baby Boomers are due to inherit an incredible £1.2 trillion from their parents.

It may seem an unlikely figure. After all, lots of pensioners don’t have all that much in the bank. But a great many of them do have a house. A house they bought decades ago, when the average property went for a fiver and a packet of crisps, but has since rocketed in value to mind-boggling heights. When they die, therefore, their children will be able to stick it on the market, and rake in the handsome proceeds. Obviously there’s inheritance tax, capital gains and so on. But there should still be a fair whack left over. And since the Boomers are by far the richest generation in history, their children will receive by far the biggest inheritance in history.

This windfall will change our society forever, for several reasons – but not all of them good. First, because the windfall won’t be equal. Some millennials will become rich overnight, while those who were born to poorer parents will get nothing. This is bound to make our society even more bitter, resentful and divided than it is now. Because instead of attacking Boomers, millennials will be attacking each other. “How can it be fair that you inherit a fortune, and I’m still penniless?” they’ll scream. “You did nothing to earn that money. Why should you get to buy yourself some big fancy house, or retire early?”

The Great Wealth Transfer may also have a dramatic effect on our politics. Put it like this. Once they inherit wealth and property, today’s Left-wing millennials may suddenly decide they aren’t so keen on socialism after all. Finally they may detect one or two upsides to capitalism, now that they have some capital of their own.

And so, to their horror, they may find themselves afflicted by a creeping temptation to vote Conservative. And not only that. Once they’ve used their Boomer windfall to buy a nice house, they may start to reconsider their constant demands for mass house-building. Out of nowhere, they may discover a deep and heartfelt passion for protecting our precious green spaces, and for preventing property developers from ruining our beautiful countryside (or at least, from ruining the view from their own houses). In short: today’s Yimbys may become tomorrow’s Nimbys.

Of course, it’s possible that the Great Wealth Transfer won’t be quite as great as experts imagine. For one thing, much of the Boomers’ wealth may ultimately get swallowed up by the costs of their care. And future Labour governments may increase inheritance tax. In which case, millennials won’t inherit very much after all.

Then again, millennials are overwhelmingly Labour voters. And if a Labour government threatens to slash their inheritance, they may threaten to stop being Labour voters. So, just as Conservative governments have repeatedly shrunk from the wrath of the Boomers, Labour governments may shrink from the wrath of the millennials.

Whatever happens, it’s bound to be bumpy. And it should confound at least one ageist prejudice.  

Many of today’s angry young Left-wingers tell themselves that once these Tory-voting Boomers are out of the way, they’ll finally be able to build a fair, just and equal society. But in reality, the demise of the Boomers may make society more unequal than ever.",2022-08-31 17:52:55,/r/ukpolitics/comments/x2jzta/the_demise_of_the_baby_boomers_will_change/,the demise of the baby boomers will change britain forever the demise of the baby boomers will change britain forever children of baby boomers are due to inherit trillion from their parents making society more unequal than ever before right now its open season on the baby boomers leftwing millennials seem to blame the postwar generation most of whom are now pensioners for everything from wealth inequality to the shortage of affordable housing indignantly they quote claims that the average pensioner now has a higher income than the average worker that pensioners control around per cent of this countrys private wealth and that one in five pensioners is a millionaire in their fury however these millennials are forgetting a small but significant fact which is that baby boomers are not immortal as a result over the next years this country is going to experience a phenomenon that experts are calling the great wealth transfer according to one estimate the children of the baby boomers are due to inherit an incredible trillion from their parents it may seem an unlikely figure after all lots of pensioners dont have all that much in the bank but a great many of them do have a house a house they bought decades ago when the average property went for a fiver and a packet of crisps but has since rocketed in value to mindboggling heights when they die therefore their children will be able to stick it on the market and rake in the handsome proceeds obviously theres inheritance tax capital gains and so on but there should still be a fair whack left over and since the boomers are by far the richest generation in history their children will receive by far the biggest inheritance in history this windfall will change our society forever for several reasons but not all of them good first because the windfall wont be equal some millennials will become rich overnight while those who were born to poorer parents will get nothing this is bound to make our society even more bitter resentful and divided than it is now because instead of attacking boomers millennials will be attacking each other how can it be fair that you inherit a fortune and im still penniless theyll scream you did nothing to earn that money why should you get to buy yourself some big fancy house or retire early the great wealth transfer may also have a dramatic effect on our politics put it like this once they inherit wealth and property todays leftwing millennials may suddenly decide they arent so keen on socialism after all finally they may detect one or two upsides to capitalism now that they have some capital of their own and so to their horror they may find themselves afflicted by a creeping temptation to vote conservative and not only that once theyve used their boomer windfall to buy a nice house they may start to reconsider their constant demands for mass housebuilding out of nowhere they may discover a deep and heartfelt passion for protecting our precious green spaces and for preventing property developers from ruining our beautiful countryside or at least from ruining the view from their own houses in short todays yimbys may become tomorrows nimbys of course its possible that the great wealth transfer wont be quite as great as experts imagine for one thing much of the boomers wealth may ultimately get swallowed up by the costs of their care and future labour governments may increase inheritance tax in which case millennials wont inherit very much after all then again millennials are overwhelmingly labour voters and if a labour government threatens to slash their inheritance they may threaten to stop being labour voters so just as conservative governments have repeatedly shrunk from the wrath of the boomers labour governments may shrink from the wrath of the millennials whatever happens its bound to be bumpy and it should confound at least one ageist prejudice many of todays angry young leftwingers tell themselves that once these toryvoting boomers are out of the way theyll finally be able to build a fair just and equal society but in reality the demise of the boomers may make society more unequal than ever,4,4_the_of_to_and,negative,0.6218709349632263,neutral,0.6765382289886475
Reddit,"Idea : Add a test in order to verify your vote. Hello everyone

So before I get into this idea I would like to first acknowledge that this will get some flak but I simply wish to add more weight to our votes and make sure everyone is in the right frame of mind and know exactly what they are voting for.

As we all know the last election that happened saw unprecedented numbers of people voting for labour just simply because they did not want the conservatives in, I for one abstained because I simply wasn’t sure where to find information and I didn’t feel like gambling my chances with any old party without knowing what they are TRULY about.

Now I know within our politics I believe there isn’t truly a way of knowing their intentions deep down and if they’ll follow through with what they promise us but I believe this will solve this problem as well.

So the idea  ? Like the title suggests I would like to put a test that includes questions about the party you’re wishing to vote for.

The reason is simply because I feel that a lot of people who vote aren’t really educated enough to come to a good truthful conclusion (myself included)

This gives politicians a chance to double down and simplify what it means to vote for them.

This also means we should put a act in place that stops them from putting promises in the test that simply aren’t true so ultimately our votes will stand for what they truly want to do for us and not what we assume they’ll do.

By all means I’m not educated politically enough to understand what complications arise from this but I’m just a common uk citizen who just wants everyone to understand politics a little better myself included and much like everyone else I want it clear , concise and straight to the point no waffle.

Let me know if you think this is a good idea and maybe even add ways you think this could be tweaked to work for us better.

Reddit,"Could this economic policy actually work or is this crackpot thinking? Discuss.. [Here](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/get-ready-keir-starmer-economy-poorer-poland-labour-jc06db9kt) is a recent opinion piece from The Times. The article is sadly paywalled, so here's a summary from digital newsletter The Knowledge instead:

>With Labour heading for a landslide, there’s a risk Keir Starmer will adopt “steady-as-she-goes incrementalism”, Matthew Syed in The Sunday Times. That would be disastrous. Britain is in a deep hole, with productivity stagnant and debt rising. “The average Pole will be richer than the average Brit within a few years.” What we need is not caution but boldness. For starters: “imagine a world without income tax.” It’s doable if we shift our tax system to one based on land values. Almost all economists think it’s a good idea, from Adam Smith to Joseph Stiglitz. A recent paper proposed that taxing the rental value of land would boost growth by 15% by “turbocharging” the incentive to work or start a business.

>A land tax would also finally end the “Ponzi scheme at the heart of the British economy”, whereby low productivity is mitigated by mass immigration and money-printing. This inflates the value of land, driving more aggressive rent-seeking and conferring ever-larger gains on the 25,000 people who own half the land in England “and have done nothing to merit this bonanza”. Radical reform of the failing NHS is also needed – “and good on Wes Streeting for saying so” – with more private sector input and a wider shift from cure to prevention. And as a human rights lawyer, Starmer is well-placed to lead a replacement to the UN’s discredited human rights body, “which is often chaired by human rights abusers” and free like-minded nations to tackle illegal migration more robustly. “Labour will fail if it is incrementalist. Only courage can save us now.”

Now, this would be an absolute **wild** move and I don't think it's something that the reserved and traditional Kier Starmer would ever even consider in a fever dream, but, putting that aside; **could this sort of policy actually work**?",2024-05-08 19:41:36,/r/ukpolitics/comments/1cndf19/could_this_economic_policy_actually_work_or_is/,could this economic policy actually work or is this crackpot thinking discuss here is a recent opinion piece from the times the article is sadly paywalled so heres a summary from digital newsletter the knowledge instead with labour heading for a landslide theres a risk keir starmer will adopt steadyasshegoes incrementalism matthew syed in the sunday times that would be disastrous britain is in a deep hole with productivity stagnant and debt rising the average pole will be richer than the average brit within a few years what we need is not caution but boldness for starters imagine a world without income tax its doable if we shift our tax system to one based on land values almost all economists think its a good idea from adam smith to joseph stiglitz a recent paper proposed that taxing the rental value of land would boost growth by by turbocharging the incentive to work or start a business a land tax would also finally end the ponzi scheme at the heart of the british economy whereby low productivity is mitigated by mass immigration and moneyprinting this inflates the value of land driving more aggressive rentseeking and conferring everlarger gains on the people who own half the land in england and have done nothing to merit this bonanza radical reform of the failing nhs is also needed and good on wes streeting for saying so with more private sector input and a wider shift from cure to prevention and as a human rights lawyer starmer is wellplaced to lead a replacement to the uns discredited human rights body which is often chaired by human rights abusers and free likeminded nations to tackle illegal migration more robustly labour will fail if it is incrementalist only courage can save us now now this would be an absolute wild move and i dont think its something that the reserved and traditional kier starmer would ever even consider in a fever dream but putting that aside could this sort of policy actually work,4,4_the_of_to_and,negative,0.6934378147125244,disappointment,0.3892405927181244
Reddit,"Report back from Witney and some news on the Lib Dem #fightback. WITNEY; secluded, yet thriving little market town located in West Oxfordshire, the seat of Ex PM Call-Me-Dave and target for any self respecting Etonian with an eye on a cushty number. Picturesque, dainty, beautiful. Had the pleasure of fladulating around its centuries old cobbled streets in awe of its Very English Setting. You can just imagine the Grundy Brothers violently garreting their way through its high Street, whilst minding their p's and q's in a rare excitable episode of the Archers.  I do wonder why more people don't holiday in England. This part of the world is stunning - if a quiet or romantic get away is your thing.

We did no polling for this by election, unlike the slightly less beautiful Tooting where (sorry, but I don't mind if I do!) we got Rossena Ali-khan's majority spot on. We've had a number of big commercial projects on lately and resources were cyphered into them; away from what *should be* a *fait accomopli* here. It's a shame really because the Lib Dems could do well and politicos are actually quite interested in assessing the scope for a rebirth of the once third party of British politics.

Where are we? Well, a clumsy yet reasonable calculation suggests that Witney went Remain by a 6 point margin. Though when you think it's own MP recommended Leave, one could imagine a veil of disappointment traverse across Ar-Mate-Dave's eyes, that the majority he commanded wasn't heavier.

At the 2015 general election, Just-a-Common-Guy-Dave, garnered a 25'000 vote majority. This just isn't going to be overturned here. This in Tory Blue-Through-n-Through territory. Anyone else winning in these circumstances would be akin to the Tories taking Wavertree. Midterm or not. It's not happening.

So we have a Remain seat which is a seemingly hard Brexit, safe Tory seat. Feel the tension? Not really. For the reasons given. Though, there is certainly space, it seems, for the Lib Dems to make some inroads on its worst performance since the creation of the constituency, when they finished third in 2015.

Stripped of its Cleggian toxicity, I have noticed a reasonable surge in sentiment for giving the Lib Dems a go. This is a seat where Whiggish One Nation Toryism is imprinted like a stick of rock and whilst it's asking too much for blue nose bowler hat wearing Shire gentlemen and corsette laden ladies to go yellowy orange for the day, en masse, there's enough life in the old Libdog yet, where many wish to hold May's feet to the fire in keeping the country as open as possible.

This is essentially the only ""small"" electoral problem that faces May at the upcoming general election. It is true that 85% of constituencies outside of London and Scotland voted Leave, but from the Cotswolds, stretching across Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire all the way through the Oxford, Bucks and Berkshire Shires down deep into Surrey; it is ironic that it was deep blue Tory England that actually flew the flag for Remain. These counties consist of solely Tory seats. Twenty-five of them followed Cameron into the defeated camp. The silver lining for the Tories and the slap in the face for the yellowy orange lot, is that they're all safe seats and many of the Remain majorities were quite narrow (within 5%).

Notwithstanding this, a space has opened for the Explicit Remainers and the Lib Dems will take at least 25% here in my view. They'll finish second and cut the majority to 5'000 - 7000 or so (on reduced turnout). Indeed, I've just put a bet on 30%. It's a good showing. It gives a boost to the Deep England Liberal movement, it will keep May on her toes, but ultimately... Alas.... It won't change much.

Enjoy your day. And next summer, check out Witney. Don't be a Philistine.

**PS**

*Spoken to a couple of hundred people already, wondering how many fancy the look of Corbyn's tweed.... 0. Labour finished 2nd here for the first time in 2015. They are being utterly pillaged. Now...

Reddit,"Why is Nicola Sturgeon the only person showing political leadership in the UK right now? Our political class are somewhat broken. Political leadership is about believing in something and arguing your case, in order to bring others on-side and turn them to your way of thinking.

In an interview a few months ago nick clegg (boo hiss) made the rather observant point that this concept has seemingly disappeared in Westminster since the 2016 referendum (and arguably well before). 

These days everything is reactionary. Its all about obsessively looking at polls and reactively doing or advocating what you think people want, rather than doing what you believe is best and justifying it to the electorate to build support.

This can be seen with brexit, where rather than selling the leave position and changing minds, we've been repeatedly told that we have to do it even though politicians don't want it. It's just what the people want and that's the end of discussion. 

We've seen it over a much longer time with the issue of immigration. Nobody is willing to actually defend the benefits of immigration (even though it is objectively beneficial and many people support it deep down) or advocate for the continuation of fom.

Everyone that is except nicola Sturgeon. She's there fighting for what she believes in, as any political leader in a representative democracy should. Rather than pandering to false narratives around immigration (or austerity or anything else) or avoiding difficult discussions, she is standing up for what she believes in, however much it may go against the 'public consensus'

Video of Sturgeon discussing immigration: https://streamable.com/yo6z7

The mistake Labour made in 2015 was pretending that austerity was justified and  playing along with the 'immigration bad' rhetoric, rather than being willing to have uncomfortable discussions where they told voters that 'whilst we know you're concerned, you're not looking at the bigger picture'. We've seen corbyn recently seemingly pandering to anti immigration rhetoric and talking about EU nationals 'replacing UK workers' as if its just accepted fact. At least he's fighting to end austerity I guess. 

It's not accepted fact, and we cannot keep allowing such misleading discussion to continue, devoid of fact or opposition. We need political leadership.

If Sturgeon wasnt a Nat I'd vote for her in a heartbeat.

The less said about the tories in recent years the better... 'tens of thousands'... Strewth

Reddit,"Alternative solution to UBI, and a radical plan to eliminate the £20billon per year Housing Benefit bill.. Firstly I'll address the UBI element. One of the biggest arguments against is naturally the inflationary aspect of UBI.

""If you promise to pay people the money they need, to obtain what they need, then the people supplying what is needed, will increase the price"" is a perfectly logical argument, and seems as though it would be tricky to regulate against. So, let's just give them what they need, starting with shelter. We need a radical plan and this is it.  Hold onto your hats.

Looking at the spending over the last ten years, I have allowed myself a budget of £220billion, with the aim of completely eliminating the Housing Benefit [HB] bill within the next ten years.

First some statistics
The current HB bill is about £20 billion p/a, with about 1/3 [670,000] in the Private rented sector [PRS]. The average weekly claim in PRS is £110 [approx]. In the Social rented sector it is about £80. I'm comfortable estimating a 50/50 split, but happy to discuss.

This leaves us with a £10 billion PRS bill, and a £10billion SRS bill. I will set aside the SRS for now, and target the PRS.

Year one: We budget for a £20billion HB bill, and spend £20 billion on new homes. At an average cost of £80k we can fulfil the promise of 250k new homes. That would appear doable, to me, but I'm no expert, and my plan is to offer these homes to the highest recipients of HB, in PRS, so I assume they will be slightly more expensive. So I will conservatively, target the top 10%. 67,000. Those homes will be given to the targeted families, to live rent free.

What happens to the 67k resulting empty properties? I don't know, but I would assume the increased supply and reduced demand would lower prices. But I'm not an economist [maybe I should have stated that earlier]. From the point of vie of my plan I see only positives. I do acknowledge the possibility of negative equity, but once my plan is complete [Mwahaha] that will be of little consequence to anybody.

Using the tried and tested 'top 20% covers bottom 80%' We could feasibly reduce the PRS bill by 40%, meaning a total bill going forward, of £16billion.

That's the first year.  Keeping tally, we have spent £40 billion to save £4 billion, but we've yet to actually save anything. We now have 600k tenants in PRS. Small steps.

Second year: We budget for the £16billion HB bill, and spend another £20billion on new homes. Assuming that we are now deep into average territory, I'm going to put my neck on the line and say we can do the 250k homes, then pull it back and say 200k is probably enough [we've got ten years after all], and we could cut the PRS bill by 30%? Is that fair? Keep me in check.

Keeping tally, we've spent £76 billion, and are now saving £6billion p/a, on top of the £4 billion we already saved. We now have 400k HB recipients in the PRS. And a further 200k properties added to the market.

Year three, rinse and repeat. £14 billion on HB, £20billion on new homes.

Keeping tally: Spent £110 billion, saved £10 billion, now saving £8 billion pa. 200k PRS claimants.

By year four I think we'd need to re-assess things, the changes to the market will have a huge impact on the plan and I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to assume the figures. This is just a starting idea after all, to demonstrate the value of providing the necessities as opposed to the finances required to purchase the necessities.

So, I will return to the issue of the SRS, and the 1.6million recipients. In my calculations, above, I have not taken into account any savings, as I don't know what percentage pay rent to a council and what percentage pay to a housing association. I'm not sure what the situation is with HA homes, but anybody whose HB goes to the council can just be given the home to live in for free.

My suspicions lead me to believe that, using this method, we can house everybody, for free, in ten years.

Let me know what you think. I expect a lot of disagreements, because obviously if it were that simple then they would have done it ten years ago. But this is just an opening idea that I think could be worked into good shape [it just needs a montage] bby minds better than my own.

Reddit,"How I went from being a Liberal Democrat supporter to a UKIP supporter (very long). How many people do you think give a damn about politics? I’d say not many. Not openly anyway. It’s odd that so few people seem to be bothered by it when you consider how much of an affect it has on people’s lives. It’s pretty much everything. From how many hours we work to how much everything costs. It’s how our countries work. It’s how the world works.


But there is a reason why so many don’t give a crap about it and find it boring to talk about. It’s not that they don’t care about it, because I think deep down they do. It’s just that they no longer trust politicians nor feel that their voices are being heard. I was discussing this with a friend of mine the other day and he made a very good point. I told him I had an interest in politics and asked if he did, he replied  “What’s the point in being bothered about politics when politicians just lie about everything?”


For over 100 years, it’s been Conservatives and Labour back and forth, with Liberals making an occasional appearance. In the most recent polls, the Tories and Labour are both at the top. But that is always the case. It makes me wonder how many people REALLY support each party, because I can’t help but feel that in many cases, it’s more about supporters not wanting the opposing ‘party’ to be in power, rather than because they are die hard supporters of one party. The other viewpoint which is also good, tends to be “In Britain, we don’t vote people in, we vote people out.”


I think many people vote for Tories and Labour out of habit, rather than because they are passionate about what they stand for. If you stopped the average Labour supporter on the street and asked them why they vote Labour, they aren't likely to say “because I like where they stand on trident”. Instead, they would probably tell you “because Tories only care about their rich friends.” Ask a Tory voter and they will likely say “because Labour gave away money too easily”. 


Both parties use the same tactics. They get voted in, spend years pissing people off, blame the previous government for all their problems, and then a few months before the general election rolls around, they admit that they made mistakes but learnt their lesson and that if you vote them in this time, then everything will be brilliant. It’s bullshit. But it’s bullshit people fall for.  Ed Miliband is merely a fresh, young face who is next up on the Labour conveyor belt, once again telling people how great everything will be if he is voted in. Except they REALLY messed up with him though. No charisma, no presence, no connection. 


In the general election of 2010, I voted Liberal Democrats. The coalition formed and Lib Dems became more or less a non-entity and were basically there to fill the numbers. I do have respect for Clegg for debating about the European Union with Nigel Farage though, but I am disappointed by the fact that if he were in power, he wouldn't even allow us to have an In/Out referendum on it. As Farage said to one audience members during the EU debate “you know why, dont you?......because you might give the wrong answer”


......and then there’s UKIP.


I have to give credit to UKIP for my interest in politics. Until the last couple of years, I didn't really know much about anything politically related. I was watching Question Time and at the time, I had considered myself to be on the Left side of the political spectrum. But every once in a while, someone from UKIP came along and made a good point that I thought the audience would completely get behind. I nodded my head in approval, knowing that a fraction of a second later I would hear the simultaneous applause from the audience. But instead, all I heard was simultaneous boos. After a while, I found myself getting annoyed by the ignorance. Instead of someone having a counter argument, like “actually Nigel, it would be silly to have control over immigration because (insert reason here)”, it was just insults. 


I always thought that people on the left side of the political spectrum (which baring in mind I considered myself a part of) were the open minded liberals and it’s those on the right who were fossils that were anti-science and wanted to go back to the ‘good old days’. I was made to believe that they were the bad guys and girls. 


I, as I imagine many reading this, saw Farage’s speeches in the EU parliment. Farage telling Rompuy  ‘I don’t know who you are. I've never voted for you and no one in Britain has ever heard of you.’ Is something extremely unorthodox to say. But here’s the thing: he’s not wrong.  


On Question Time, every time anything EU related was brought up, the audience collectively sighed. Every time immigration was brought up, the audience called him racist. He was getting more insults than the people in power who were actually screwing people over. As I mentioned earlier, the left wing lot (in my mind) were typically meant to be the more tolerant lot and it’s the right wing who are supposedly the crazies, and yet over the last couple of years, I have seen the opposite to be true with regards to UKIP. While UKIP are the ones who want to debate the issues, the people on the left side of the political spectrum seem to only want to insult. Verbally and sometimes even physically. 


I LOVE debates. The great thing about debates is that if you win an argument, that means you might have turned someone else into your way of thinking. If you lose or come up short, it usually means someone else has brought up a point that you hadn't considered.........but that still adds to your overall knowledge about the topic. 


But no, the opposing parties, the media and indeed the people weren't doing that. They were, as Nigel Farage said, “going for the player rather than the ball”. Personal attacks everywhere. Someone said “he hate’s Europeans.” I reminded this person that he is married to a German woman. That the love of his life is a person from another country. “Oh well then that just makes him a hypocrite” was the response I got. People like to be ignorant towards certain things because they need their hatred to be justified. 


Immigration is a very big deal, and yet whenever having controlled immigration was mentioned, the word ‘racist’ was thrown about. Immigration is GOOD for this country. Immigrants contribute A LOT to this country. But when it is forecasted to have several tens of thousands of immigrants per year, and you instead get several hundred thousand per year, that is a problem. It’s the ‘too much’ problem. Too much of anything isn’t good. 


It’s like having sugar in your tea (stick with me!). If someone asks you how many sugars you want in your tea, and you say ‘two teaspoons please’, and they put one, then two, then three, then four then five and you say ‘woah thats too much’. Should they be saying “OH SO YOU OBVIOUSLY HATE SUGAR! YOU SUGARIST!”? of course not. What you have received is too much and is not a sensible amount. 
  

There are then the attacks on the stupid things that people say. Every time a UKIP member says something controversial, the media jump on it. It trends on twitter. It makes the papers. Every party has members that do stupid things. Tories and Labour most certainly do, but I suppose the media outlets reporting them figure that isn’t interesting news and it’s much better to feed the UKIP hate bandwagon. A lot of it is sharebait. It’s people on twitter knowing they’ll get favourites and retweets if they insult UKIP. 


“Is it any wonder that we have three parties who act the same, look the same and have no opinions, if every time someone uses a word that perhaps they ought not to the media jumps down their throat?” – Farage


When Farage makes the point that UKIP are the only party the prevents former BNP members from joining them, the interviewers always move to a different question.  


In the Euopean elections of 2014, something great happened. UKIP won. This marked the first time in 100 years that any party other than the main two had won in a nationwide vote. 


Farage has said that our country is too soft on illegal immigrants. People called him a racist. Then only a few weeks ago, over 1000 illegal immigrants came over to Calais, some of which having passed through a dozen European countries simply to get to England, which in their eyes is the land of gold. If you don’t think our country is too soft on immigrants, why would illegal immigrants travel 3000 miles through nearly a dozen countries that have the same EU human rights laws that we have, simply to get to our country? Answer that if you can, I’m curious to hear your responses. 


Then........Rotherham. 1400 girls abused between 1997 – 2013. The people who could have done something about it decided not to for fear of being called racists. I mentioned in another post, that Farage said the law should be equal for everybody, no matter what skin colour or religion. I was insulted for agreeing with him.  In spite of this horrific event, UKIP’s detractors tend to ignore it entirely. 


When Farage was being interviewed on TV, a mate of mine said “he’s racist he is”. I asked him why he thought that and he shrugged his shoulders and said “dunno.....just is”. He had probably read it mentioned in the paper and figured ‘well if the papers say it then it must be true’. 


UKIP’s European election victory has ultimately led to UKIP and especially Nigel Farage getting more airtime. This has allowed him to get more of his opinions and policies out there and, over the last few months, I have seen or heard more and more people saying “I never thought I’d say this, but I agree with him.”


He is a fantastic public speaker and is probably the only politician I’ve ever know to admit when he and the party have gotten something wrong, and to admit if he doesn’t know an answer (one interviewer said it was ‘refreshing’ to have a politician admit they didn’t have an answer to a question). 


The trouble is, I am afraid that when it comes to the next general election, UKIP will probably not get in. The Tories and Labour and Liberal Democrats will all be singing the same tune. They won’t attack Farage on his politics. They will play on your fears. They will tell you that UKIP is the ‘great unknown’ and that if we leave the EU, the world will end. They will tell you that UKIP hates Europe. **People call politicians liars and yet will continue to believe them**. People also don’t seem to know the difference between Europe and the EU. One is a continent and the other is a political establishment. UKIP hates the European Union but loves Europe. 


I saw on the news the other day that during the Labour conference, Ed Balls said “we have learnt from our mistakes”. Both Labour and Conserative use this line each time an election is coming up and people still fall for it. “Aww, well maybe this time they truly have learnt from there mistakes” is what people will think. These are the people that need reminding just how tried and tested Labour and Conservatives are.
 

I don’t believe any political party sets out to ruin the country. That wouldn’t make sense. But the current establishment aren’t running it well, and that is evident by the lowest amount of trust in politicians that I’ve ever known. You know what LabLibCon are about. They’ve been in power in one form or another many times over the last 100 years. UKIP **are** something different. Ignore insults and detractors. UKIP are not racist (they have multiple ethnic minority candidates). They are not homophobic (they have an LGBT group within UKIP)  and they are not anti-European (remember the EU/Europe difference).


Look into what changes they want to put in place. Make up your own mind.


I think UKIP is the change that Britain needs and it is extremely likely that come next May, I will be going to the polling station and crossing the box that says United Kingdom Independence Party.

telling rompuy i dont know who you are ive never voted for you and no one in britain has ever heard of you is something extremely unorthodox to say but heres the thing hes not wrong on question time every time anything eu related was brought up the audience collectively sighed every time immigration was brought up the audience called him racist he was getting more insults than the people in power who were actually screwing people over as i mentioned earlier the left wing lot in my mind were typically meant to be the more tolerant lot and its the right wing who are supposedly the crazies and yet over the last couple of years i have seen the opposite to be true with regards to ukip while ukip are the ones who want to debate the issues the people on the left side of the political spectrum seem to only want to insult verbally and sometimes even physically i love debates the great thing about debates is that if you win an argument that means you might have turned someone else into your way of thinking if you lose or come up short it usually means someone else has brought up a point that you hadnt consideredbut that still adds to your overall knowledge about the topic but no the opposing parties the media and indeed the people werent doing that they were as nigel farage said going for the player rather than the ball personal attacks everywhere someone said he hates europeans i reminded this person that he is married to a german woman that the love of his life is a person from another country oh well then that just makes him a hypocrite was the response i got people like to be ignorant towards certain things because they need their hatred to be justified immigration is a very big deal and yet whenever having controlled immigration was mentioned the word racist was thrown about immigration is good for this country immigrants contribute a lot to this country but when it is forecasted to have several tens of thousands of immigrants per year and you instead get several hundred thousand per year that is a problem its the too much problem too much of anything isnt good its like having sugar in your tea stick with me if someone asks you how many sugars you want in your tea and you say two teaspoons please and they put one then two then three then four then five and you say woah thats too much should they be saying oh so you obviously hate sugar you sugarist of course not what you have received is too much and is not a sensible amount there are then the attacks on the stupid things that people say every time a ukip member says something controversial the media jump on it it trends on twitter it makes the papers every party has members that do stupid things tories and labour most certainly do but i suppose the media outlets reporting them figure that isnt interesting news and its much better to feed the ukip hate bandwagon a lot of it is sharebait its people on twitter knowing theyll get favourites and retweets if they insult ukip is it any wonder that we have three parties who act the same look the same and have no opinions if every time someone uses a word that perhaps they ought not to the media jumps down their throat farage when farage makes the point that ukip are the only party the prevents former bnp members from joining them the interviewers always move to a different question in the euopean elections of something great happened ukip won this marked the first time in years that any party other than the main two had won in a nationwide vote farage has said that our country is too soft on illegal immigrants people called him a racist then only a few weeks ago over illegal immigrants came over to calais some of which having passed through a dozen european countries simply to get to england which in their eyes is the land of gold if you dont think our country is too soft on immigrants why would illegal immigrants travel miles through nearly a dozen countries that have the same eu human rights laws that we have simply to get to our country answer that if you can im curious to hear your responses thenrotherham girls abused between the people who could have done something about it decided not to for fear of being called racists i mentioned in another post that farage said the law should be equal for everybody no matter what skin colour or religion i was insulted for agreeing with him in spite of this horrific event ukips detractors tend to ignore it entirely when farage was being interviewed on tv a mate of mine said hes racist he is i asked him why he thought that and he shrugged his shoulders and said dunnojust is he had probably read it mentioned in the paper and figured well if the papers say it then it must be true ukips european election victory has ultimately led to ukip and especially nigel farage getting more airtime this has allowed him to get more of his opinions and policies out there and over the last few months i have seen or heard more and more people saying i never thought id say this but i agree with him he is a fantastic public speaker and is probably the only politician ive ever know to admit when he and the party have gotten something wrong and to admit if he doesnt know an answer one interviewer said it was refreshing to have a politician admit they didnt have an answer to a question the trouble is i am afraid that when it comes to the next general election ukip will probably not get in the tories and labour and liberal democrats will all be singing the same tune they wont attack farage on his politics they will play on your fears they will tell you that ukip is the great unknown and that if we leave the eu the world will end they will tell you that ukip hates europe people call politicians liars and yet will continue to believe them people also dont seem to know the difference between europe and the eu one is a continent and the other is a political establishment ukip hates the european union but loves europe i saw on the news the other day that during the labour conference ed balls said we have learnt from our mistakes both labour and conserative use this line each time an election is coming up and people still fall for it aww well maybe this time they truly have learnt from there mistakes is what people will think these are the people that need reminding just how tried and tested labour and conservatives are i dont believe any political party sets out to ruin the country that wouldnt make sense but the current establishment arent running it well and that is evident by the lowest amount of trust in politicians that ive ever known you know what lablibcon are about theyve been in power in one form or another many times over the last years ukip are something different ignore insults and detractors ukip are not racist they have multiple ethnic minority candidates they are not homophobic they have an lgbt group within ukip and they are not antieuropean remember the eueurope difference look into what changes they want to put in place

[This is from the same journalist that wrote an account of the disastrous Brexit dinner a few months ago.]

Half a year ago, Theresa May was at the height of her powers. She had opted for the ""hard Brexit"", praised ""global Britain"", initiated the withdrawal from the European Union and even called for new elections. May wanted more power. When Jean-Claude Juncker sat at her table in Downing Street and poured water into the wine, she went deaf. No bad news, please! She lives in a different galaxy, the President of the Commission rained afterwards.

Earlier this week May and Juncker met again for dinner, this time in Brussels. But now everything was completely different. May didn't trumpet, she pleaded for help. She talked about the risks she had taken when she had recently given up the hard Brexit course and asked for a transitional period of two years in which everything should remain the same. She recalled that she had also moved on the sensitive issue of finance. And she let it be known that her friends and foes are sitting at home, waiting to overthrow her. She has no room for maneuver, May said, the Europeans must create it for her.

Theresa May appeared anxious, despondent and discouraged to the President of the Commission. A woman who hardly trusts anyone, but is not ready for a liberation strike either. May's facial expressions and her appearance spoke volumes. This is how Juncker later described it to his colleagues. Anyone can see that: the Prime Minister is marked by the struggle with her own party. She wears deep rings under her eyes. She looks like someone who can't sleep for nights. You rarely see them laughing, of course, it is necessary for the photographers. But it [the laughter] appears tormented. In the past, May could literally throw herself out laughing, her whole body vibrating. Now she's putting up the utmost strength to keep her composure.

At the last minute, May had asked Juncker for an appointment. Prior to that, she spoke on the phone with Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron. Charm offensive is what they call it, but it doesn't fit here. They were cries for help. May knew that the Heads of State and Government were not prepared to confirm ""sufficient progress"" in the negotiations at the end of the week. This blocked the road to the second phase of the negotiations on the future. The Prime Minister wanted to pave at least one path: could the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier not be given a mandate to talk about the transition period following her request for it?

EU wants to talk about money

This would have been an important success for May. It would have watered down the rigorous negotiation plan. And it could have reassured the island's business community. Because they become more nervous with every day a chaotic, unregulated exit approaches. Several banks have already begun to execute their contingency plans, renting offices in Frankfurt or Paris, relocating business units. Others are getting ready. In the economy, no one can rely on hopes or wishes. And as a rule of thumb, jobs and production sites that are gone for the time being do not return. It's not worth moving twice.

The Europeans are only too aware of the British people's needs - they are their biggest leverage in the negotiations. That's why Merkel, Macron and Juncker couldn't be softened. All three insisted on further progress, especially on the sensitive issue of money, before there could be direct talks on the future. The [german] chancellor's office says dryly that none did not want the Brexit and could not solve the problems of the British for them. In Paris and Brussels, May heard nothing else. The Europeans had coordinated.
Nevertheless, however, it was not and should not look as if they were turning down the Prime Minister. Merkel, Macron and Juncker know exactly how fragile their situation is. At the same time, they recognize that May no longer has any illusions about the effects of the Brexit. Her initial threat that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" is no longer a factor in the negotiations. Macron has publicly pointed this out, and this is confirmed in Berlin. With her Florentine speech, May has already taken a different course. She admitted how bad it would be for the British economy if the country were to be catapulted out of the internal market from one day to the next. Boris Johnson, you foreign minister, is completely different: he still tells people that they are enjoying a ""great future"", even without a deal. It's better to negotiate with a realistic May than with the dreamer Johnson, that's how the calculation on the continent works. That's why her defeat at least had to be nicely wrapped up.


Pictures of the day are deceiving

Juncker said goodbye to her after dinner and he can do it like no other. The joint communiqué spoke of a ""constructive and friendly atmosphere"". Yes, the efforts should even be ""accelerated"". May's people were able to sell this to their media for half a day - until chief negotiator Barnier soberly pointed out that it always took two to accelerate.

When the [german] Chancellor arrived at the European Council on Thursday, she also said a few friendly sentences. Progress in the negotiations is not yet ""sufficient"", but ""encouraging to continue the work and to reach the start of the second phase in December"". Merkel and Macron went to the conference hall together afterwards - May in their midst. You could see the three of them in the animated conversation, these were the pictures of the day. One could not see that they were not even talking about the Brexit, but about the nuclear agreement with Iran.

May's last-minute diplomacy did not change the political conclusions of the Brexit negotiations. These had already been agreed between the EU ambassadors a week before the summit. The Governments and the Barnier team will therefore begin ""internal preparatory consultations"" on future relations with London and a transitional phase. This is a positive response to May's Florentine speech. Negotiating circles explain that without such a preparation it would not be possible to enter the second phase anyway. After all, guidelines must be drawn up again. The negotiators are confident that their papers will be leaked, and they have already priced it in: they are not talking directly to London, but the British government will find out the exact position of their partners.

Significant progress has so far been made in divorce negotiations only in the rights of the four million citizens who will be directly affected by the withdrawal - because they will then live on the ""other"" side. Eighty percent of London has already covered eighty percent of the way, they say internally. The biggest issue is likely to be resolved in the next few weeks: the British negotiators are now open to the European Court of Justice's arbitration after the Brexit.

Finances were taboo

The issue of Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is proving to be extremely complicated. While both sides agree that there should not be a ""hard land border"" on the island of Ireland, they have very different solutions in mind. The choice of path depends on future relations. Therefore, in spite of all the difficulties, Northern Ireland is not standing in the way of a transition to the second phase of the negotiations.

The real obstacle is money. The remaining 27 states require the United Kingdom to recognise all financial commitments it has entered into as a member. According to calculations by the EU Commission, this amounts to a good sixty billion net. The Council, as an institution of the Member States, has reached ninety billion euros. The difference is related to other items and cost estimates. Somewhere between the two numbers lies the zone in which London must end up.

At first, the British Government did not even want to take off. Finances were taboo. Then May made two decisions in Florence. On the one hand, she promised that her country would continue to pay into the EU budget until the end of 2020, i. e. even after leaving the EU in March 2019, which corresponds to a good twenty billion euros net. Curiously enough, it was the weakest position in the Europeans' exit account. This amount was promised only in the context of medium-term financial planning, but not by budget decision. However, May is likely to follow a tactical approach. Politically, it is the easiest way to sell this sum. If their country were allowed to stay in the internal market for another two years after the brexit, it would have to pay for it anyway.

Secondly, in Florence, May said a simple sentence:""The United Kingdom will recognise the commitments we made during the membership phase"", and that was a good thing from the point of view of the Europeans. But what does it mean exactly? What obligations? From the EU's point of view, it is in any case a matter of unpaid invoices (31 billion euros), future pension costs (9 billion euros), special funds (4 billion euros) and the assumption of liability risks. No one is asking London to give concrete figures now. The bill would only come to the withdrawal and could be broken down over a long period of time. However, he said, May had to commit herself to the individual positions.

The clock is ticking

She's recoiled before that. Of course, the Brexit hardliners would moan out loud in the Tories and in the media - they wanted to leave the European Union precisely because of the British net contributions. Johnson, perhaps Brexit minister David Davis could then also take a lethal strike. Nevertheless, Europe's politicians do not want to give in at this point. Berlin and Paris cannot do it at all, because as the largest net contributors, they themselves were left sitting on the costs. It would be a super bail-out for Britain.

The clock is ticking, chief negotiator Barnier reminds us of it on every occasion. The next EU summit will take place in mid-December. In Brussels, a man with great political experience formulates the challenge for the next few weeks in this way: May has to explain to her people why the cost of a chaotic Brexit is much higher than Brussels' bill. And how will that work? From now on, every bad news about Brexit is good news for May, the man says. The darker the prospects are, the sooner she can open her wallet.

From that point of view, it may not have been such a bad week for the Prime Minister. Their Ministry of Finance reported a record inflation rate of three percent - prices are rising. A research institute calculated that ordinary families would have 300 euros less to spend a year if customs duties were due again in trade with the continent. And the OECD, the Club of Industrialised Countries, recommended that the Brexit should be cancelled altogether, or at least that it should strive for a ""close"" relationship with the EU.",2017-10-22

**Text**

Universal Credit has several objectives, some more, some less explicit. Overall, these seem to fall within two categories: increasing employment and decreasing cost. To achieve the first, UC aims to improve predictability as well as increased self-management of recipients. The predictability of a benefits system is an important factor in reducing disincentives to work, as Kristian Niemietz explains with the following analogy: suppose you are faced with a choice between two restaurants. On average, both are equally good. But one of them offers a constant level of quality, while at the other one, it varies hugely from visit to visit. Due to risk-aversion, most people prefer the former.

Applied to welfare, this means that recipients are reluctant to take up work or increase their hours if they do not know how that will affect their total income. It is thus hoped that simplification (i.e. replacing a system of multiple withdrawal rates with one single withdrawal rate) will increase the number of people in employment – even if the average withdrawal rate is not substantially different, compared to the old system.

Additionally, payments are restructured to more closely mirror how an employee would receive a wage and use it to cover all costs. Specifically, a UC recipient receives a single monthly payment, which contains all benefit entitlements including (what is now) housing benefit. This money must then be budgeted by the recipient to meet all bills and expenses. On the one hand, this is a significant step towards increased independence and responsibility by benefit recipients. Instead of being treated like children, they are able to manage their own “income”, which prepares them for a life of employment.

On the other hand, this takes a simplified view of both the circumstances of life of many recipients, as well as of the reaction of other economic agents to such increased responsibility for benefit recipients, as will be seen later. The reform also includes smaller changes to boost employment, such as increasing self-employment start-up periods.

Regarding the second aim, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) seeks to simplify the system of six legacy benefits to reduce waste and fraud. Considering that government statistics show £3.2bn pounds lost to fraud and error between April 2010 and March 2011 alone, reducing the waste of taxpayer money is definitely a worthwhile aim. However, it seems that the DWP also attempts to save costs through the introduction of long waiting periods before applicants receive their first payment. While this may be a short-term relief for taxpayers, it has brought hardship on many already poor applicants, and has thereby been one of the major drivers of the harsh criticisms of UC’s rollout.

The ongoing struggle of UC Implementation

The ideas behind UC may have been sensible, however, the implementation has been flawed to say the least. Criticism has been vehement and may well have developed into an outright scandal, had it not been crowded out by Brexit. Some problems “merely” concern the roll-out of UC, others go deeper into the underlying design of the system. Major issues with the roll-out have been failures of the IT system – by replacing those of the individual legacy benefits there is the potential to greatly streamline the process of managing benefit applications, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. However, it appears the system was simply not prepared for such a task: service centre employees have described it as “fundamentally broken and poorly designed”. It was this lack of preparation that caused repeated delays and rescheduling of the roll-out, so that it currently is six years behind its original schedule. It also led to further extensions of the already prolonged waiting period for an applicant’s first payment: in 2017 the DWP admitted it failed to process payments on time in 20% of cases, often leading to waiting times of 10 to 12 weeks. For poor people without significant savings, a disruption in cash flow of such a length can bring serious hardship. While it is possible to apply for an advance to bridge the gap, this necessitates another bureaucratic process and, more importantly, requires repayment within a short time frame. On a tight benefit budget, such short-term debt will entail deep spending cuts. The transition is likely to be especially hard on those who only recently came into financial hardship and were not previously recipients of a “legacy benefit”, as these will be declined advance payments if they have previous debt.

The hardship caused by this arrangement has made its way into the statistics through the increase in rent arrears and food bank uses after the roll-out. The foodbanks run by the Trussell Trust alone saw their visitor numbers increase by an extraordinary 170% from 2011-2012 to 2012-2013. Although numbers had been steadily increasing in the previous years, this jump stands out both in absolute and relative terms. Significantly, 43% of all visitors in the second year were referred to a foodbank because of benefit problems, and this share grew to over half of all recipients in the following year. This clearly shows an incapability of the new system to handle the accurate determination and distribution of benefits. A similarly substantial development can be observed for rent payments: the number of registered issues in social housing due to rent arrears increased by 13% from the second quarter of 2012 to the same period in 2013. The number of cases of threatened homelessness increased by 12% in the same period. Universal Credit also had a massive impact on the average amount owed in rent by tenants in arrears: in 2018, tenants on Universal Credit owed on average £400 more in rent than those still receiving the ‘legacy’ housing benefit. For one of the counties that has migrated to Universal Credit, the council’s rent arrears have increased by a staggering £1m in the 18 months since implementation. It is difficult to say what proportion of this is due to the extended waiting period rather than the new policy of leaving the payment of rent to the benefit recipient. However, the DWP claims that the share of people with rent arrears falls by a third after several months on UC suggesting that a proportion of comparable size either falls into arrears because of the extended waiting period or because they struggle with budgeting their income towards paying rent in the transition period before getting a hang of it after a few months. Considering the real consequences that this roll-out has brought on the poorest in society, the widespread criticism that UC was not ready for implementation, nor ready to react to and learn from problems along the way, seems more than justified. Numerous delays have been scheduled and adjustments implemented since the initial start of the roll-out to deal with those problems, including the decrease of the planned waiting period to five and then three weeks.

The issues of implementation described before should largely go away once UC is finally rolled-out completely and the old “legacy benefits” are gone. However, some issues with UC go deeper; they are a matter system design rather than teething trouble. One is that after going through the strains of a waiting period, recipients will be reluctant to do so again – as this becomes necessary every time a couple splits up into two individual recipients, it could, for example, trap people in abusive relationships. Further, while the reliance of UC on online-based applications has the potential to make it very time- and cost-efficient, it goes beyond the possibilities of some claimants. One does not have to look far to find tales of benefit claimants who lost part of their benefits due to their incapability to handle the online process. And it seems that this is not the only area where the DWP has unrealistic expectations of claimants’ capabilities to cope with the new system. According to a survey by Citizens’ Advice, 85% of the interviewed said they would need support with more than one category out of budgeting, making monthly payments, getting online or even opening a bank account and using banking facilities. Even though the underlying idea of the monthly payment is to mirror life in employment, research has shown that only half of those earning less than £10,000 pounds a year are paid on a monthly basis, with the remainder receiving their wage in bi-monthly or even weekly intervals. Such a shortening of intervals between payments is likely to make budgeting easier.

Similar problems have arisen regarding rents payed to landlords by benefit recipients themselves rather than through the state: through promoting responsibility of recipients it has the potential to increase their independence from state paternalism and prepare them for managing their own affairs once employed. However, research supports the fear that in many cases, the result is not improved management of finances but rather rent arrears and evictions. As landlords have only imperfect information on a new tenant’s responsibility, it is rational for them to either increase rents to welfare recipients to make up for the increased risk or refuse to let to them altogether. The latter is, in fact, exactly the development that can be observed: according to the National Landlords’ Association, the number of landlords willing to let to tenants on benefits has fallen from 34% to 20% between 2013 and 2017. This can only mean that it is now much harder for benefit recipients to find housing on the market, thereby probably leading to increased calls for the provision of social housing by the state.

However, another study has found that while there is a substantial drop in rent payments in the first three payment periods of a tenant, afterwards payments are only slightly below those of the control group. It therefore seems that the added responsibility indeed improves claimants budgeting skills: around 40% of participants agreed that these had made them better at managing their money. As hoped for, there even was a positive effect on employment by participants. While the jury is therefore still out on the behavioral effects of increased budgeting responsibility on tenants and landlords, there are aspects of the new budgeting system that are clearly ineffective: for example, childcare expenses must be paid well in advance before they are reimbursed by the government. For a family running on a very narrow budget, this may even deter parents from taking up employment, as ironically the childcare it necessitates would require temporary debt. This can trap parents in unemployment.

Economic Theory tells us that, as rational actors, we should ignore sunk costs in our decision making: past investments into a project should not be taken into account when deciding whether to scrap it. Even most economists fail to follow this advice in everyday life, so it can be safely assumed that voters will not view the waste of their taxpayer money invested in UC in such a ‘rational’ way. More importantly, the ideas of predictability and streamlining embedded in Universal Credit are actually a desirable step forward towards higher employment and financial efficiency and as such worth keeping. Scrapping Universal Credit would therefore be an unnecessary waste. Nevertheless, after the preceding discussion, its reform seems almost inevitable. Therefore, the roll-out should be continued without any unnecessary waiting periods. An additional investment is probably necessary into the administrative capacity of the UC system, to ensure it is able to create efficiency gains. The empirical evidence on the effect of increased budgeting responsibilities for recipients should be more closely examined, and it must be ensured recipients have sufficient help both with IT skills and budgeting. All these might create additional costs in the short-run, but are fundamental to ensuring the system runs efficiently, creates fair results and pays off in the long run. When trying to cut costs, half-hearted implementation cannot make up for structured and thought-through reforms and will most likely produce worse results in the long-run. Recipient incentives should always be kept in mind and any inefficient ‘traps’ avoided.

Parts 1 and 2 demonstrated that while Universal Credit (UC) has the potential to increase efficiency, improve employment incentives and promote recipient independence, there are flaws both in its implementation and the underlying system. At this point, it seems helpful to consider developments in the welfare models of other countries. Take Germany, for example.

Its system consists of two parts: one is the infamous Hartz IV, similar to UK unemployment benefits – based on basic need. However, there also exists another payment with much more of a state-insurance character: it can only be received by those who have worked at least 12 months in the last two years, and the amount paid and the length of entitlement depend on the previous wage earned and time spent in employment by the recipient. Thus, the average replacement rate, signifying the percent of previous earnings received in benefits payments, is much higher in Germany than in the UK for short periods of employment, but becomes virtually the same for long periods of unemployment, as the recipient falls from the insurance-type payment to Hartz IV payments. This two-tier system can incentivise efforts in employment, as it pays off even when a temporary phase of unemployment hits. Furthermore, it prevents an immediate forced adjustment to lower living standards for those who have only just entered unemployment. On its implementation in 2005, Hartz IV was a prestige project by Germany’s centre-left and itself as radical a change as UC is today.  However, although it is widely credited with causing the impressive decrease in unemployment seen since, it is also increasingly criticised for being too harsh on recipients. Its inventors’ attempt to remedy this has stimulated various reform proposals.

To the UC-savvy observer, one reform suggestion, found across the political spectrum, stands out: the demand to streamline the German welfare system by combining several payments including unemployment benefits, child support and housing support into one payment and one administrative system – in short, to “universal credit” it. The advantages and problems do not need to be repeated here, but it seems that German policymakers would be well-advised to consider the lessons that can be learned from the British UC implementation.

In the other direction, one German idea in particular is worth considering: that of the “liberal” party, FDP, for a reform of the taper rate. This rate signifies how much of a pound (or euro) earned by a benefit recipient will be taken away, after a certain disregarded amount called the work allowance, through a reduction in their benefit payment. This rate cannot be too low for obvious reasons, but at the same time, when too high, it disincentivises employment. The UK has a flat taper rate. It was adapted several times under UC and currently stands at 63p per pound earned. By contrast, the German Hartz IV system involves a rising taper rate, meaning that the more you earn, the higher the rate becomes. This has had the unintended consequence of disincentivising recipients from increasing their work hours, thereby damaging their prospects of re-entering full employment. The FDP now suggests not to make the taper rate flat but rather to reverse it: let the taper rate decrease as a recipient’s income increases. One example is a taper rate of 80% for incomes under €300, 70% up to €700 and 60% for incomes above, although considering a current rate of 63%, it may be advisable to set each of those rates comparatively lower. This incentivises participants to increase their working hours by making an increase in their income doubly financially advantageous.

Should the ongoing dissatisfaction with UC lead to further reform, British policymakers should take this chance to increase employment incentives further. Government data show that the costs of the decrease in the British taper rate which was already implemented are far outweighed by the savings of decreasing the work allowance, where the first sets much stronger incentives for increased work. It can be expected that implementing a decreasing taper rate as proposed by the FDP may even lead to savings in the short run. It may lead to increased costs once a large share of recipients starts earning in the category with the lowest taper rate. However, this would entail positive effects for recipients’ prospects of entering full employment as well as the economy as a whole.",2019-07-31

credit what went wrong part the implementation part the design part lessons from germany text universal credit has several objectives some more some less explicit overall these seem to fall within two categories increasing employment and decreasing cost to achieve the first uc aims to improve predictability as well as increased selfmanagement of recipients the predictability of a benefits system is an important factor in reducing disincentives to work as kristian niemietz explains with the following analogy suppose you are faced with a choice between two restaurants on average both are equally good but one of them offers a constant level of quality while at the other one it varies hugely from visit to visit due to riskaversion most people prefer the former applied to welfare this means that recipients are reluctant to take up work or increase their hours if they do not know how that will affect their total income it is thus hoped that simplification ie replacing a system of multiple withdrawal rates with one single withdrawal rate will increase the number of people in employment even if the average withdrawal rate is not substantially different compared to the old system additionally payments are restructured to more closely mirror how an employee would receive a wage and use it to cover all costs specifically a uc recipient receives a single monthly payment which contains all benefit entitlements including what is now housing benefit this money must then be budgeted by the recipient to meet all bills and expenses on the one hand this is a significant step towards increased independence and responsibility by benefit recipients instead of being treated like children they are able to manage their own income which prepares them for a life of employment on the other hand this takes a simplified view of both the circumstances of life of many recipients as well as of the reaction of other economic agents to such increased responsibility for benefit recipients as will be seen later the reform also includes smaller changes to boost employment such as increasing selfemployment startup periods regarding the second aim the department for work and pensions dwp seeks to simplify the system of six legacy benefits to reduce waste and fraud considering that government statistics show bn pounds lost to fraud and error between april and march alone reducing the waste of taxpayer money is definitely a worthwhile aim however it seems that the dwp also attempts to save costs through the introduction of long waiting periods before applicants receive their first payment while this may be a shortterm relief for taxpayers it has brought hardship on many already poor applicants and has thereby been one of the major drivers of the harsh criticisms of ucs rollout the ongoing struggle of uc implementation the ideas behind uc may have been sensible however the implementation has been flawed to say the least criticism has been vehement and may well have developed into an outright scandal had it not been crowded out by brexit some problems merely concern the rollout of uc others go deeper into the underlying design of the system major issues with the rollout have been failures of the it system by replacing those of the individual legacy benefits there is the potential to greatly streamline the process of managing benefit applications increasing efficiency and reducing costs however it appears the system was simply not prepared for such a task service centre employees have described it as fundamentally broken and poorly designed it was this lack of preparation that caused repeated delays and rescheduling of the rollout so that it currently is six years behind its original schedule it also led to further extensions of the already prolonged waiting period for an applicants first payment in the dwp admitted it failed to process payments on time in of cases often leading to waiting times of to weeks for poor people without significant savings a disruption in cash flow of such a length can bring serious hardship while it is possible to apply for an advance to bridge the gap this necessitates another bureaucratic process and more importantly requires repayment within a short time frame on a tight benefit budget such shortterm debt will entail deep spending cuts the transition is likely to be especially hard on those who only recently came into financial hardship and were not previously recipients of a legacy benefit as these will be declined advance payments if they have previous debt the hardship caused by this arrangement has made its way into the statistics through the increase in rent arrears and food bank uses after the rollout the foodbanks run by the trussell trust alone saw their visitor numbers

I pity terrorists.  I don't mean this in a scornful way to insult them.  I mean I view them as deeply troubled individuals, who are so full of burning hate they feel compelled to commit murder and even kill themselves in the process sometimes.  How twisted do you have to be to do such a thing against innocent civilians?  Carrying hatred around is a burden.  These people are so weighed down by their hate that they BREAK.  

As people, they have been broken, crippled, by hate.

Whatever their reasons, be they quasi-religious or reactions to western intervention, it doesn't justify terror tactics.  These attacks are basically mini war crimes.

I'm not a Christian, but Jesus said to love thy enemy.  I agree with this.  Everyone has good in them if you dig deep enough.  Deep inside the twisted external beliefs of a terrorist, is a good person, who has been buried, but is still alive.

Hate the evil, not the person.  Terrorists are sad, fucked up individuals.   

I'm not a pacifist.  Even though I believe in loving thy enemy, evil needs to be destroyed, even if it means killing someone who, at their core, is just a human being like the rest of us.  The key thing is not to hate the people.  Hate the ideology.  Hate the evil that is in them.  But all human beings deserve love.  If we could change the mind of the terrorist, we would, to save them as well as their victims.

I just wanted to make this point.  It's easy to jump to judgement that a murderer is 100% evil through and through.  People are more complicated than that though and even the worst people on Earth probably have a few admirable characteristics.  But they choose to act on the evil, which is sad for them and even worse for everyone else.

Love thy enemy.  It's still relevant today.

Reddit,"On the issue-illiteracy of the House of Lords Government defeat. I can't say I was at all impressed by the standard of debate in the Lords on the EEA amendment to the Withdrawal Bill, but in this game you take what you can get.

That was a defeat for the government with 245 voting for an amendment requiring the government to include as a negotiating objective an international agreement that will enable the UK to continue to participate in the EEA after exit day. 

In all, 83 Labour peers defied Jeremy Corbyn's instruction to abstain from the vote, joined by 50 crossbench peers, 17 Conservatives and 84 Lib Dems. With 218 voting against, and that makes for the 13th government defeat in the Lords on this one Bill, but by far the most significant. It strikes at the entire core of Mrs May's Brexit strategy, and puts the Commons on notice. 

However, with neither Mrs May nor Corbyn supporting the amendment, it would take a remarkable turn of events for it to succeed in the lower house, requiring an independent turn of mind that has rarely been seen in a bovine assembly where tribal loyalties are the driving force. 

It would have helped if the Lords had framed their debate in a way that could carry the case through and give the MPs a head start. But, with the motion sponsored by Lord Alli, we had a very poor advocate for the Efta/EEA option – one who did us no favours at all. 

""The customs union amendment that we passed overwhelmingly a few weeks ago"", he started off by saying, ""is only one half of the equation"", then telling us that: ""The customs union deals only with goods"". 

""That"", he said, ""is very important: it deals only with goods - tangible items such as cars, washing machines and televisions - where we have a £96 billion trade deficit"". On the other hand, he averred, ""the EEA deals with services - such as retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace, where we have a £14 billion trade surplus"". 

Thus, according to this noble Lord, ""the customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports, but without an EEA equivalent, it will damage our profitable export business and therefore the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people"". For that reason, he concluded, ""we need to ensure that any continuation in the customs union must include continuation in the EEA or its equivalent"".

This is issue-illiteracy at a very advanced level and with friends like him, one has to ask, who needs enemies? 

Nevertheless, the motion had enemies aplenty, with assassin-in-chief coming in the form of Labour's Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town. A former chief executive of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, she was doing her duty by the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, by formally asking ""colleagues"" to abstain on the amendment. 

Making the cogent and entirely correct point that the UK could not be a member of Efta and the customs union, she chose to weigh in behind ""this House's support for a customs union"". Having regard to what she argued were ""possible practical problems associated with Efta membership"", she turned the debate into a binary issue – an either/or choice between the customs union and the EEA. 

From the other side, we then got Lord Callanan who, in opposing the motion on behalf of the government, trotted out all the same turgid clichés, with only the slightest of modification to take in the years of vibrant debate on the issue. 

The EEA, the noble lord opined, ""would not deliver control of our borders or our laws"". Ignoring completely Article 112 and the Liechtenstein/Swiss strategy, he further opined that, ""on borders, it would mean we would have to continue to accept all four freedoms of the single market, including freedom of movement"". 

""On laws"", this dim creature continued, ""it would mean the UK having to implement new EU legislation on which, in future, we will have little influence and, of course, no vote"".

Callanan, true to the best traditions of the House, had ignored previous contributions to the debate. Had he been listening, he would have heard a reference to Articles 112 and 113 from Baroness Altmann, with her noting that ""if there is serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties immigration can be curtailed"". But, even that limited intelligence was tempered by Altmann's insistence that this was ""an emergency brake"".

Earlier, Labour's Lord Howarth of Newport added his ignorance to the community pot, earnestly telling us that that agriculture and fisheries were ""not part of the terms of reference of the European Economic Area"". Therefore, he said, ""membership of the EEA would do nothing to assist us in resolving the problems of the Irish border"".

Notwithstanding that food safety and marketing standards are part of the EEA acquis one should also not that there is provision for including both agriculture and fisheries within the EEA structure, in country-specific protocols. This is part of what makes the EEA Agreement a uniquely flexible structure which would allow the UK to negotiate a ""bespoke"" deal specific to its needs. 

But such a concept is way beyond the pay grades of their noble Lords. But then, given their extraordinary ignorance demonstrated during the customs union debate. I suppose we should not be surprised by this. But it does knock one back a bit to realise the depths to which our legislators have sunk. (http://eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=86837)

Two decades ago, we used to look to the Lords as a repository of good sense, where experienced people could be relied upon to raise the standard of debate above that prevailing in the mere, vulgar Commons. But no more. The lack of grasp of the essential issues has sunk so low that not a single contributor to the debate would have lasted seconds on these blog comments, before being ripped apart. 

Let no one say, therefore, that the vote turned on the oratory or wisdom of the House. Fortunately for us, a rebellious mood prevails and, in retrospect, it would appear that the outcome was pre-ordained. Together with a vote on agency participation and another removing the specific exit date from the Bill, that made for a hat-trick of defeats for the government, all in one day. 

Once the EEA amendment reaches the Commons, it will have as its champion son of Neil Kinnock, the hyperactive Stephen who, by contrast with their lordships, is a repository of knowledge. 

Writing earlier in the day, in the Guardian, he managed to cover most of the bases. And even though his knowledge is skin deep, he positively shines in comparison to his colleagues. (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/08/eea-vote-lords-theresa-may-brexit-suropean-economic-area-post-eu)

Unfortunately both he, and his co-enthusiast Chuka Umunna are both positioned in the ""remain camp"" and thus allow detractors to present their support for this cause as an attempt to dilute Brexit, or make it easier in the future to rejoin the EU. 

This in turn rests on the canard that the EEA is a halfway house to joining the EU, an error even I made in the early days. The history of the Agreement, however, clearly shows that it was cast as an alternative to the EU, not as an ante-room. And, as a member of Efta, the UK could not be a member of the EU. It could not even take part in a customs union with the EU.

However, if yesterday's vote has catapulted the EEA to the top of the UK political agenda, it is only to the extent that it will now be churned over by a clueless media and then subject to a parade of ignorance in the Commons. It is too much to hope that MPs might educate themselves on the issues prior to the debate. They've had years to do that and have failed spectacularly. They are hardly going to start now. 

In the meantime, we still have to go through the charade attendant on Mrs May's ""customs partnership"", and the irritating distraction on Mr Johnson's posturing. When these two have finished, they will be left with an agreement (or not) on a structure that has already been rejected by the EU, and will not gain acceptance no matter how it is dressed up. 

With Irish popular sentiment turning away (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-ireland-population-majority-remain-eu-poll-border-solution-theresa-may-latest-a8340941.html) from the contortions of the UK government, and falling behind the EU, to an unprecedented level, taoiseach Varadkar is able to assert that if real and meaningful progress on Brexit is not achieved at the June European Council, ""it is difficult to see how we will be able to come to an agreement by October at all"". (https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/lack-of-brexit-progress-by-june-will-bode-badly-says-taoiseach-1.3488482)

That is the real world intruding – one that is being ignored by the UK legacy media and politicians alike. Their parade of ignorance trumps anything else, and only when they have run out of time with they finally have to concede that their noise has achieved nothing at all. 

Rather, their ignorance is set to drive us over the cliff edge. And for all the high drama of yesterday, all that really happened was that we came another 24 hours closer to the edge. The only good thing is that, on 9 May, this is the last ""Europe Day"" we will celebrate as members of the EU. 

It's a shame that the price set by our own politicians is so unnecessarily high.

government defeat i cant say i was at all impressed by the standard of debate in the lords on the eea amendment to the withdrawal bill but in this game you take what you can get that was a defeat for the government with voting for an amendment requiring the government to include as a negotiating objective an international agreement that will enable the uk to continue to participate in the eea after exit day in all labour peers defied jeremy corbyns instruction to abstain from the vote joined by crossbench peers conservatives and lib dems with voting against and that makes for the th government defeat in the lords on this one bill but by far the most significant it strikes at the entire core of mrs mays brexit strategy and puts the commons on notice however with neither mrs may nor corbyn supporting the amendment it would take a remarkable turn of events for it to succeed in the lower house requiring an independent turn of mind that has rarely been seen in a bovine assembly where tribal loyalties are the driving force it would have helped if the lords had framed their debate in a way that could carry the case through and give the mps a head start but with the motion sponsored by lord alli we had a very poor advocate for the eftaeea option one who did us no favours at all the customs union amendment that we passed overwhelmingly a few weeks ago he started off by saying is only one half of the equation then telling us that the customs union deals only with goods that he said is very important it deals only with goods tangible items such as cars washing machines and televisions where we have a billion trade deficit on the other hand he averred the eea deals with services such as retail tourism transport communications financial services and aerospace where we have a billion trade surplus thus according to this noble lord the customs union only will benefit our european neighbours in their imports but without an eea equivalent it will damage our profitable export business and therefore the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people for that reason he concluded we need to ensure that any continuation in the customs union must include continuation in the eea or its equivalent this is issueilliteracy at a very advanced level and with friends like him one has to ask who needs enemies nevertheless the motion had enemies aplenty with assassininchief coming in the form of labours baroness hayter of kentish town a former chief executive of the european parliamentary labour party she was doing her duty by the party leader jeremy corbyn by formally asking colleagues to abstain on the amendment making the cogent and entirely correct point that the uk could not be a member of efta and the customs union she chose to weigh in behind this houses support for a customs union having regard to what she argued were possible practical problems associated with efta membership she turned the debate into a binary issue an eitheror choice between the customs union and the eea from the other side we then got lord callanan who in opposing the motion on behalf of the government trotted out all the same turgid clichs with only the slightest of modification to take in the years of vibrant debate on the issue the eea the noble lord opined would not deliver control of our borders or our laws ignoring completely article and the liechtensteinswiss strategy he further opined that on borders it would mean we would have to continue to accept all four freedoms of the single market including freedom of movement on laws this dim creature continued it would mean the uk having to implement new eu legislation on which in future we will have little influence and of course no vote callanan true to the best traditions of the house had ignored previous contributions to the debate had he been listening he would have heard a reference to articles and from baroness altmann with her noting that if there is serious economic societal or environmental difficulties immigration can be curtailed but even that limited intelligence was tempered by altmanns insistence that this was an emergency brake earlier labours lord howarth of newport added his ignorance to the community pot earnestly telling us that that agriculture and fisheries were not part of the terms of reference of the european economic area therefore he said membership of the eea would do nothing to assist us in resolving the problems of the irish border notwithstanding that food safety and marketing standards are part of the eea acquis one should also not that there is provision for including both agriculture and fisheries within the eea structure in countryspecific protocols this is part of what makes the eea agreement a uniquely flexible structure which would allow the uk to negotiate a bespoke deal specific to its needs but such a concept is way beyond the pay grades of their noble lords but then given their extraordinary ignorance demonstrated during the customs union debate i suppose we should not be surprised by this but it does knock one back a bit to realise the depths to which our legislators have sunk two decades ago we used to look to the lords as a repository of good sense where experienced people could be relied upon to raise the standard of debate above that prevailing in the mere vulgar commons but no more the lack of grasp of the essential issues has sunk so low that not a single contributor to the debate would have lasted seconds on these blog comments before being ripped apart let no one say therefore that the vote turned on the oratory or wisdom of the house fortunately for us a rebellious mood prevails and in retrospect it would appear that the outcome was preordained together with a vote on agency participation and another removing the specific exit date from the bill that made for a hattrick of defeats for the government all in one day once the eea amendment reaches the commons it will have as its champion son of neil kinnock the hyperactive stephen who by contrast with their lordships is a repository of knowledge writing earlier in the day in the guardian he managed to cover most of the bases and even though his knowledge is skin deep he positively shines in comparison to his colleagues unfortunately both he and his coenthusiast chuka umunna are both positioned in the remain camp and thus allow detractors to present their support for this cause as an attempt to dilute brexit or make it easier in the future to rejoin the eu this in turn rests on the canard that the eea is a halfway house to joining the eu an error even i made in the early days the history of the agreement however clearly shows that it was cast as an alternative to the eu not as an anteroom and as a member of efta the uk could not be a member of the eu it could not even take part in a customs union with the eu however if yesterdays vote has catapulted the eea to the top of the uk political agenda it is only to the extent that it will now be churned over by a clueless media and then subject to a parade of ignorance in the commons it is too much to hope that mps might educate themselves on the issues prior to the debate theyve had years to do that and have failed spectacularly they are hardly going to start now in the meantime we still have to go through the charade attendant on mrs mays

Reddit,"The Parliamentary Dilemma & Solution. Attached is a document detailing an aspect of the problems faced by Parliament regarding Brexit, the underlying cause of the dilemma, and a solution offered that will guarantee a parliamentary decision.

The Referendum has created an intolerable precedent, which Parliament needs to be seen to resolve with initiative and common sense. Conversely, for the House of Commons to remain set in it's ways and allow the present uncertainty to continue is, readers may agree, not in the interest of the people of the United Kingdom, Parliament, or our present Partners within the European Union.

\-----

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.

The contents of this document highlights within item 1. the absolute underlying cause of the dilemma facing Parliament.  Item 2. offers a solution that guarantees a parliamentary decision.

**1.**	Much has been said by the United Kingdom government in terms of “The British people have asked us to leave” the European Union.  There will be a “deep humiliation if we do not leave”. “We have a mandate to deliver”. Indeed spokesmen have said, we “must honour democracy”. **Contrary to this, the widely known truth concerning the Referendum indicates beyond any doubt whatsoever,** **there has been** ***as yet*** **a lack of responsibility shown with respect to:-**

1. The widely acknowledged absence of correct information, at the time of the Referendum.
2. There was also general and deep absence of initial understanding, of the associated problems.
3. The United Kingdom ‘voters reference’ 	relative to the ‘impact of leaving the European Union’, was to 	take up to three years for Members of Parliament to understand and later consider.

**The consequence of which has proved to be the underlying cause of more chaos within Parliament, than at any period of time during the past one thousand years!**

The personality who may be considered to be more responsible than others for the Brexit position, has recently been made the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; based on the vote of a relatively modest number of members of the government party. The new Prime Minister has been delegated the task of resolving, the very significant level of problems which Brexit has introduced.

The Prime Minister has indicated No Deal, to be the most likely way forward.  Yet ‘No Deal’ had no part in the terms of the Referendum, and certainly cannot be seen as the  democratic way forward and to be honoured – bearing in mind that a majority of the well-informed spokespersons have warned of serious consequences a ‘No Deal’ departure will almost certainly entail. These are matters that have become allied with the spoken intentions of some, to descend to a reckless level of un-parliamentary procedures in the name of so called democracy!

The great majority of Members of the House of Commons are of conscience and surely required to act in the national interest and with honour, reflecting the former United Kingdom Parliament’s standards of democracy.

Having read some of the known consequences of ‘No deal’ forecast by the government, one is obliged to raise the question – why would any responsible government inflict deliberately such state on the population?  Certainly the poor and needy would become least able to withstand such a deliberate and wholly avoidable situation. The rest of us will be considerably inconvenienced, businesses hampered or worse, and some of the population would be placed medically at risk.

Note.

Briefly: one aspect of the background to the writer **– prior to recommending a viable solution to the House of Commons voting dilemma.**

I am now retired, however during my consultative career as an authoritative adviser in the field   of human relations in business and industry, on two occasions such were the problems of government **–** this writer offered guidance to each of two Prime Ministers who, in turn, listened and in their different ways chose to be so advised.

During the early nineties, this writer approached professionally in a Consultative capacity, Prime Minister John Major: before whom I was pleased to place an understanding associated with the 'underlying cause’ and ‘vital remedy' for the *then* *current* 15% and rising rate of inflation: an underlying problem, ***that could be shown*** **to** ***be*** ***the consequence of a certain lack of understanding within the government as a whole at that time***\*.\* My report became passed on for the serious consideration of members of the forthcoming International ‘G’ Conference for the year concerned. The subsequent outcome *soon to follow*, was a reduction of the United Kingdom high bank rate – to a figure close to the acceptable low-rates that have continued since that time.

**2.**   	May one convey for the readers’ currently consideration, an unusually advanced and parallel knowledge and experience **– associated with governmental human and parliamentary relations, concerning aspects of those matters which are considered at this time by Parliamentarians, to be more at fault than for a thousand years**.

**(i)  	The undoubted underlying cause of the present serious dilemmas facing the House of Commons,** has been the unparallel lack of knowledge presented in support of the former Referendum.  **So diverse was the subject matter, which necessarily unravelled** **during the three years following the** **Referendum;** that many Members of Parliament felt obliged to act with conscience in the national interest, in order to halt matters **–** prior to some of those who were seeking to advance Brexit were to realise – **there had did not exist an appropriate policy** that would be a sufficient requirement, in the event of the United Kingdom having to face leaving the European Union.

**(ii)**  This writer is in a position to indicate an undoubted solution to the present uncertainty which is creating a poor image of Parliament within the United Kingdom; also in the minds of many observers overseas.

**Concerning item (i) above.**

**The Referendum outcome produced a shock to the political establishment**. May I comment briefly on the subject of the noticeable strength of feelings *(associated with many people including politicians)* when they refer to the subject of “an obligation demanded by the result of the Referendum”: an issue which many refer to mistakenly, as “a democratic responsibility”.

**Factually.**

(a)       A little under half of United Kingdom voters were inclined towards staying within the European Union: **most of these voters understand by years of experience, that which belonging to the European Union tends to involve.**

(b)        Most of the *small majority* of voters who were inclined towards leaving the European Union, **knew very little at the time of the Referendum concerning what leaving the Union would** ***in reality*** **entail.**  They were guided and encouraged via misinformation and opinions, concerning that which were said to be the expectations and benefits which suppositions *only* at that time could either suggest or imply.

With concern for United Kingdom Parliamentary Standards of Democracy **–** the knowledge available at the time of the Referendum,  reflected an unusually low-level of the understandings required – if one is to seek to justify the present day reference to the Referendum as a democratic procedure which must be upheld.

(c)        There have been numerous consecutive occasions where the House of Commons has been asked to vote upon Brexit measures. On several such 	occasions, there has been no majority reached. This 	is a position that many perceive **–** is tending to create levels of falling respect, both within and towards our Parliament at home and overseas.

The incoming Prime Minister has been said by President Trump, to be very much like himself.  Some Conservatives have noted, the new Prime Minister engages in statements which he considers attracts support to his name – viewpoints shown in the past that he may at times be less well-informed about, than is to be considered a vital requisite for a national leader.

The Prime Minister is said by many to be more responsible for the chaos introduced by Brexit, than anyone else.  Most certainly it would be true to convey that he among many others, were in no way aware of the required policies in support, that would be acceptable to the parties involved. The general lack of understanding that has been involved, has recently been presented as **–**

On the one hand voices indicating in their view, “Democracy requires of us that Brexit must be concluded”. “We have a mandate to deliver.”

On the other hand, the Prime Minister and some others have expressed a willingness to prorogue Parliament, in order to limit debate on the subject of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without an agreement. **Could anything be less** **less** **democratic, than to extend a prorogation of our Parliament which reflects the governing voice of the people?**  It needs to be stated emphatically, that ‘no deal’ forms no part in the terms of the Referendum.

Indeed the Referendum can be shown to reflect, an ultimate in low standards of democracy: when considered in terms of the very limited terms of reference and information provided for the United Kingdom population, when asked to form their viewpoints and vote. One refers here to a variety of matters, concerning which Members of Parliament have since needed three years to unravel.

One is saddened by a need to remind the reader – the terms of a Parliamentary Community, when increasingly built on sand, must become weakened.

**Concerning item (ii) above.**

Common sense indicates the circumstances referred to, reflect a precedent. A serious issue, that may need a further precedent, in order to resolve suitably the judicious outcome that is the need of this time.

A Spokesman for the European Union, also the former UK Prime Minister has said during the recent past, **“The need is to know, what the House of Commons does want: not what it does not want!""** There has been *an unseen and appropriate* encouragement associated with the latter complete lack of a decision making process: this being a requirement of Votes which acknowledge o*nly* the ‘APPROVAL’ of Members the House of Commons –  for a select number of options –  in order TO ASCERTAIN THE LEVEL OF ‘VOTES OF APPROVAL’, for the MOST POPULAR and finally selected OPTION.

The latter indicates a truly Democratic Procedure, which can bring closure to the present uncertainty.  It will need the issues to be reduced to perhaps four or five seriously considered options, that the House is ultimately willing to consider – dependent upon the Speaker’s final decision, should this be necessary.

The final selection of options should each be debated by Members of the House of Commons, in the understanding that each of the chosen options are to be presented and debated, **prior to** a Subsequent Formal Session of the House of Commons when – ***o*****nly then** – will voting upon these closing options take place. The purpose of which, will be to record *only* the number of ‘VOTES OF APPROVAL’ with respect FOR EACH SELECTED OPTION.

At the 'Subsequent Formal Session' of the House of Commons - *each option having then been measured* *separatel\*\*y* *b\*\*y* *the number of* ***Votes of Approva****l g****iven to each o****p\*\*tion by Members of the House* \- **the option receiving the least number of Votes of Approval,** **should then be set aside.** This stage in the voting – to be followed by another Vote of Approval – taken separately upon each of the remaining options.  The process to continue, **pending the position being reached, whereby only two options remain.**

**The subject matter appertaining to the above remaining Votes of Approval, should then be set before the House: thus reflecting the two most supported remaining options, concerning which a deciding vote needs then to be taken.** The clear outcome of the latter Vote of Approval should  be accepted, as the majority final decision of the House of Commons concerning the Brexit issue.

THE NEED HAVING BEEN TO ASCERATAIN – which option gained the largest proportion of House of Commons Votes of Approval.

Members of the House would BE AWARE that by the above democratic process, each of the serious options would have been debated and voted upon, separately.  This in order to arrive at a majority of Parliamentary Members, having thus reached a decision within a democratic pathway \~ with each Approval Vote having been open to all members of the House at every stage of the above process.  In this way \~ concentrating Members minds upon the total levels of Approval, reached by the House during the described stages.

It is to be seen *–* the above recommendation would of itself create a precedent.

The present voting of the House on government business associated with the Referendum, has reflected a divisive and regretfully underinformed decision, taken by a little over half of the voters at the time of the Referendum *-* *who unfortunately lacked the knowledge which more recently,, has become slowly available to Members of the House of Commons and others – a Referendum decision thereby, which was not entirely achieved by an honourable democratic process.* We have witnessed the outcome having proved more divisive, than anything recorded before during the history of Parliament.

The Referendum has created an intolerable precedent, which Parliament needs to be seen to resolve with initiative and common sense.  Conversely for the House of Commons to remain set in it’s ways and allow the present uncertainty to continue is, *readers* *may agree*, not in the interest of the people of the United Kingdom, Parliament, or our *present* Partners within the European Union.

May one recommend the above proposal be considered by those whom you the reader may invite, please, to consider such a highly desirable precedent?

Only twice before and during my Consultative career, has this writer ventured to approach Prime Ministers with positive recommendations.  The Voting Public and Parliament were witness the value of the second such occasion, which may encourage you to offer the above advice, at your discretion.

For myself I seek no publicity \~ only an appropriate reconciliation of the present Parliamentary dilemma, for which no former government precedent exists.

Thank you for your time, and potential interest.

Yours faithfully,

Robert Wood-Smith.

*Formerly  –*  an Incomes & Productivity Consultant at a national level: proposals in support of which this writer provided for Prime Minister Harold Wilson whom with his approval, conveyed the proposals to Aubrey Jones, Chairman of The National Board for Prices and Incomes.  The Chairman, following detailed examination by his executives, approved ""festina lente” the relative report. \[**The National** **Board** for **Prices and Incomes** was created by the government of Harold Wilson in 1965, in an attempt to resolve the problem of inflation in the British economy, by managing wages and **prices**.

Note: *The stated approved proposals were later stalled by the Minister for Employment, who declined to engage in discussion of matters beyond the prevailing concept of that time.*\]

**When at a later time, parallel proposals were presented to John Major**: this writer’s report was placed before the annual ‘G’ conference, and taken up by the United Kingdom and others at their discretion. The fruits of which, all continue to enjoy unto this day.

Reddit,"For the good of the country, Theresa May needs to remove David Davis as chief Brexit negotiator by Mary Dejevsky. From Indy's *Voice* section [SOURCE](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/david-davis-brexit-negotiator-theresa-may-remove-uk-eu-leave-a8388261.html) by always good for a giggle Mary Dejevsky.

>**As bad luck would have it, Michel Barnier has exactly the same central flaw as his counterpart Davis – and that has made the Brexit negotiations almost impossible for everyone involved** 

>Was it just the latest squall in the UK government’s long passage towards a negotiating position, or a hissy fit on the part of David Davis, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator? Perhaps even a bit of both?

>It is hard to tell. But whatever it was seems now, after a fevered 24 hours, to be over. The government rushed out its plan for future trade with the EU, saying (at the very end) that, in the absence of any formal agreement on new customs arrangements, any continuation of the status quo would last no more than an extra year. This so-called back-stop would, in other words, have a time limit, and a pretty short one at that.
 
>Such minimal fine-tuning was apparently enough for the resignation talk to subside – which perhaps illustrated how shallow, and how much of a ploy, it really was. But this is, in a way, unfortunate, because the issues at stake are still live.

>Deep down, Brexiteers fret that the prime minister is not, and has never really been, on their side, and will weasel through a deal that falls well short of the clean break with the EU that they demand. The back-stop, as a temporary solution to the conundrum of the Ireland border, they fear, could became a non-solution that leaves the UK partially shackled to the EU forever. And what if, after the back-stop year has passed, there is still no permanent customs agreement in sight? What price, the supposed clarity of intention and timescales David Davis has secured?

>The plain truth is that the government is riven with factionalism on Brexit, there is no trust or team spirit, and the chief negotiator is at one end of a spectrum of views. It might have looked a wise move at the time for Theresa May to appoint leading Brexiteers to frontline Brexit roles – not least because it helped compensate for her own preference for Remain. If the thinking was sound, however, the particular division of portfolios has failed.

>And perhaps the biggest misjudgement was the appointment of David Davis to combine the posts of secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU and chief negotiator. At very least, those two functions should have been distinct: as the one faces towards Westminster and the home Brexit constituency; the other faces Michel Barnier across the table in Brussels.

>That there were already difficulties was evident when the prime minister transferred Oliver Robbins, the chief civil servant in Davis’s department, to what was described as a coordinating position at the Cabinet Office. But she did not complete the job by transferring Davis to another department or, as a simpler solution, replacing him as chief negotiator.

>Now I don’t want to cast aspersions on David Davis. He is a thoroughly admirable character. His career as an SAS officer testifies to all sorts of personal qualities – from courage to resourcefulness to resilience – that set him apart. He is a man of great personal principle, as when he resigned his seat in 2008 over what he saw as unacceptable anti-terrorist legislation. And his support for Brexit surely reflected something of the same independence of mind, while his sense of principle and responsibility may help explain why he accepted a leading position in the government charged with negotiating the terms.

>But being an admirable character is not the same as being an accomplished or effective negotiator. In many ways, you could argue that many of Davis’s own qualities – consistency, principle and practicality – almost militate against his succeeding in such a role. Not only that, but he is up against a master of the art in Michel Barnier, the French chief negotiator for the EU, whose charm, guile, and long experience of delicate bargaining are some of the reasons why he was chosen for the job.

>As bad luck would have it, however, Barnier has one flaw as a Brexit negotiator, and it is one he shares with Davis: he appears as French as Davis appears English, and neither evinces much cultural sensitivity or familiarity with how the other side actually thinks. The differences between the French and the English can be hugely productive; they can also produce a comprehension gap that is one of the widest in Europe. At times, with Barnier and Davis, even the translation has left something to be desired.

>To give them their due, both chief negotiators have striven valiantly to show good humour and get along. But it is hard not to believe that if one or the other, or both, were more internationally attuned – a latter-day Douglas Hurd, a Nick Clegg, dare I say a Boris Johnson, for the UK – the talks would have progressed with fewer misunderstandings than they have, regardless of what was going on in the respective capitals.

>Not that the negotiators, of course, are untethered operators. And from a plethora of Brexit discussions I have attended in London and elsewhere in recent months, one message has come through loud and strong. It is that responsibility for the snail’s pace of the Brexit talks lies not in Brussels or anywhere else in what we must now call the EU27, but in the UK, which has still – a full two years after the referendum, and more than a year since Article 50 was invoked – not managed to finalise its negotiating position.

>But the choice of negotiators matters. It is partly about personal relations across the table, but also because the job – as with ambassadors – entails not just talking, but assessing the mood and communicating back. It is understandable that Theresa May would be reluctant to change her chief negotiator at this stage. The more time goes on, the more such a move would smack of weakness and divisions in London.

>That said, the weakness and divisions are there for all to see. How much is there to lose? The latest spat has shown David Davis’s leverage at home. So leave him at the Department for Brexit, accept his resignation as chief negotiator on a point of principle (a pity that the most recent opportunity was missed), and send someone else to joust with Michel Barnier in Brussels.

>That someone – and it doesn’t have to be a serving politician – needs a stellar command of French (and France) and firsthand experience of how the EU really works. Then let’s see how far the negotiations are really stuck, what compromises can be made (by our side, too), and try to arrange what now seems to be the UK’s inevitable departure with common sense and,

Reddit,"Andrew Tyrie, Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee on the Brexit bill. A backbencher but one that has sat on very many treasury meetings and so rather more informed.

6.47 pm  31/01/2017

**Mr Andrew Tyrie (Chichester) (Con)**  

>I was a remainer and I think it was a mistake to leave. I still think it is a mistake to leave, but that decision has been taken and tomorrow night the House will respect the decision. The question now is not whether we are leaving but where we shall arrive. We must focus on the best way of securing that, not only in our interest but in the interests of the whole continent. We need to grasp the opportunities of Brexit, which do exist, and their significance. The Prime Minister was right to say that she is going to seek a bold and ambitious trade agreement with the EU. Anything that disrupts trade is likely to diminish it and, therefore, output. A deal that safeguards both the UK and our counterparties from that disruption is therefore much needed, and in practice there may be only a little over a year to negotiate it.  

>So, a transitional arrangement—probably a formal agreement—is going to be absolutely essential. Without it, firms in the financial sector, for example, will act pre-emptively to protect their shareholders from the consequences of a cliff edge. A large number of them have given evidence to the Treasury Committee on exactly that point, and they are not all making it up. The action they will take has already begun in a small way, and it is much more than just brass plating. We need to be clear that the absence of a transitional agreement will cost jobs and economic activity, at least in the short to medium term, and we should not just let that business slip away.  

>A clear and early commitment from the Government to a transitional period—what I and a number of others have been calling a standstill—at the end of the article 50 process should be priority No. 1 for agreement at the start of the negotiations.  

**Wes Streeting**  

>I am grateful to the Chairman of the Treasury Committee for giving way. Does he agree that such transitional arrangements are not only in our national interest, but in the interests of every other EU member state, which is why they should agree to the Government’s suggestion sooner rather than later?  

**Mr Tyrie**  

>I agree. Other states have an opportunity to agree a deal, because it would be obtainable under qualified majority voting, and does not require unanimity, as a careful look at article 50 shows, although that point was not initially understood.  

>If the UK leaves the customs union, a huge amount of work will be required to develop and enforce rules of origin. Despite the extra bureaucracy, I still think there is merit in leaving. If the greatest opportunities turn out to be in Asia in the medium to long term, as many forecast, we should put the country in a position to benefit. I strongly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh), who is no longer in his place, that a liberal economic internationalism should underpin everything we try to develop in our trade relations.  

**Dr Andrew Murrison (South West Wiltshire) (Con)**  

>I agree with much of what my hon. Friend has had to say. Does he agree that TheCityUK’s analysis has, it would appear, changed dramatically? Like him, it can see the advantages that might come from Brexit, having once been of the opinion that Brexit would the worst possible thing for this country’s financial sector.  

**Mr Tyrie**  

>TheCityUK did say that it was the worst possible thing for the financial sector, and it has clearly decided that the best thing to do is to look for the opportunities rather than spend time moaning about where we are. On the basis of what I read on my iPad on my way to the debate, it has focused on the point about the customs union.  

>The Treasury Committee has heard convincing evidence that both parties in the negotiations—both the EU and ourselves—have a lot to gain from maintaining a high degree of access to the single market, and a lot to lose from the absence of such access. We should bear it in mind that the EU, like the UK, benefits from our integration with European supply chains in the automotive and aerospace sectors, for example, and we all benefit from access to London’s deep and liquid financial markets, which lowers the cost of capital to European firms, and of course to British firms. Restructuring manufacturing supply chains would cost both sides a lot; so, too, would the fragmentation of the financial markets.  

**Sir Gerald Howarth**

>Will my hon. Friend give way?  

**Mr Tyrie**  

>I will not, if my hon. Friend will forgive me, for the same reason previously mentioned—I will not get any extra injury time.  

>Unlike the customs union, access to the single market is certainly not a binary choice: a wide variety of options is possible. We do not need to look into the crystal ball; we can read the book. Switzerland has better access than Saudi Arabia; Canada has better access than Columbia. Reverting to WTO rules would be a huge risk for the UK—one that we should do a great deal to avoid.  

>There is a majority in the country for leaving, and if that means anything it must mean an end to the direct applicability of EU law and the restoration of control over EU migration. We should also bear it in mind that there is certainly a majority in the country for a high degree of continued engagement with our closest neighbours, which many on the continent also want. Huge advantages can flow from maintaining a high degree of political and economic engagement from outside the EU. It can be as economically beneficial as it will be politically expedient to try to construct it. It can help heal the Brexit wounds to which the Prime Minister referred in her outstanding speech, and it can address the deep unease that seems to be developing about Brexit among the young. Many of them are rejecting much of the irrationality of current political discourse coming out of Washington, and many are certainly rejecting the populist economic nationalism that President Trump represents, which some also attribute to Brexit.  

>In demonstrating that we understand and are responding to those voices of concern, we can win support at home, and we can construct alliances among our counterparties abroad by making it clear that we want to engage deeply with the EU from outside. That is why, if we can avoid the politics of unreason and avoid, too, the divisions at home and abroad that a disorderly and confrontational Brexit could bring, we can still reap considerable opportunities from the Brexit decision.

**Legend** for projects of same type:AI = artificial intelligence / algorithmsS = satellites

**Not included (*****important*****!)**: social media in general, media and education in general, sustainability standards and certifications and checks (e.g. FSC; for: wood, mines, bioenergy, beef, soy, ...; anything related to supply chain monitoring in general), projects to replace paper and beef (including accessible educational media and its dissemination), projects to reduce land-use for beef-production, projects for recycling, unrelated projects for land-management, projects for policy changes (such as [drug policy reforms](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/1/140130-drug-trafficking-deforestation-central-america-environment-policy-reform/), compensations for land-owners, changes to subsidies, limits or bans of beef, for availability of data, trade-related ones, [results-based payments](http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2019/10/21/as-2020-approaches-the-climate-action-spotlight-is-on-forests/)), projects on environmental monitoring technology in general, projects for poverty-reduction and alternative source of income (basic income or subsistence farming can be such) or employment (reforestation or production that depends on healthy forest [like chicle gum](https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/where-find-plastic-free-chewing-gum.html) can be such). They also don't include those that address (identify, blame, boycott, regulate, tariff) the [companies](https://stories.mightyearth.org/amazonfires/index.html), [countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/opinion/china-brazil-amazon.html) and [financiers](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/27/amazon-rainforest-fire-blackstone/) behind e.g. the Amazon fires. [""Fires are being put out most quickly by residents when they are in indigenous territory"" and therefore ""more indigenous territory means more guardians of the forest""](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/amazon-fires-indigenous-lands/596908/). [Community-managed greenhouse gas sinks](https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A-Global-Baseline_RRI_Sept-2018.pdf) is considered one of the best ways to address climate change. [Fires in the Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Amazon_rainforest_wildfires) are [still burning](https://usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/18/amazon-rainforest-still-burning-more-fires-future/4011238002/) and the Amazon isn't the only forest that's getting damaged/burned.

**Notes:** this includes deforestation via logging and wildfires that weren't set intentionally and containment of fires set to e.g. fields or savanna. ""Proforestation"" includes prevention of deforestation and maximizing the potential of existing forests - the latter of which is not included here. The tools and methods developed by the projects of the list could be seen separately from their implementations.

# Why preventing deforestation is more important:

From the latest [Global Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4793e.pdf) it seems to be clear that it would be more effective to stop deforestation than to allow it to happen and subsequently reforest.

For example, [as the European Commission writes](https://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-08-632_en.htm):

>In terms of environmental services, it is better to avoid deforestation than to cut down trees and reforest subsequently, as deforestation leads to some irreversible effects in terms of biodiversity loss and soil degradation.

[On Wikipedia it says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation#Criticisms):

>There is also the risk that, through a forest fire or insect outbreak, much of the stored carbon in a reforested area could make its way back to the atmosphere.

and according to [this recent study and its report](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y) the probability that legacy carbon (organic carbon that has escaped earlier fires and has accumulated at the surface of boreal-forest soils) will be released from soil is higher in younger boreal forest.

Furthermore it can be harder to rebuild a forest than to prevent its destruction. This is also because a healthy forest requires biodiversity and other things. For example some trees used in some reforesting efforts can prevent the growth of other plants and can prevent growth of diverse vegetation. This in turn can for example also lead to more destructive wildfires in (re)forested areas. [Jonah Busch states](https://earthinnovation.org/2019/05/reforestation-can-help-reverse-the-climate-and-extinction-crises/) that:

>Avoided deforestation offers ten times as much abatement as reforestation at $20 per ton

while:

>reforestation is more cost-effective than avoiding deforestation in some places

Moreover, [according to a 2019 study global greenhouse gas emissions caused by damage to tropical rainforests are being underestimated by a factor of six](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/31/climate-emissions-from-tropical-forest-damage-underestimated-by-a-factor-of-six).

And of course [the effects of af- or reforestation will be farther in the future than those of proforestation](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-keeping-mature-forests-intact-is-key-to-the-climate-fight).

The main issue with reforestation as a solution is that:

>Perhaps the biggest difficulty with reforestation as a strategy is simply that it takes so much time to reap the benefits for global warming. If you plant a seedling today, it will take several decades to get the same carbon sequestration benefits we get from mature trees in tropical forests. So, in the short and medium term, reforestation cannot offer nearly as much benefit as limiting deforestation in the first place.

[as Doug Boucher, UCS Director of Climate Research and Analysis has put it](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/would-reforestation-help-counter-deforestation).

[Here](https://theconversation.com/want-to-beat-climate-change-protect-our-natural-forests-121491) ""the protection and recovery of carbon-rich and long-lived ecosystems, especially natural forests"" is called ""**the major climate solution**"".

>Natural forest systems, with their rich and complex biodiversity, the product of ecological and evolutionary processes, are stable, resilient, far better at adapting to changing conditions and store more carbon than young, degraded or plantation forests. \[...\] proforestation is a more effective, immediate and low-cost method for removing and storing atmospheric carbon in the long-term than tree planting \[...\] Instead of planting entirely new areas, we should prioritise reconnecting forested areas and restoring the edges of forest, to protect their mature core. This means our carbon-storing forests will be more resilient and longer-lasting.

* [There are also **other carbon sinks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) \- including ""ocean afforestation"" - but most aren't as straight-forward and effective as (protection of) forests.
* Forests for climate change mitigation is also about the soil. **Soil health** is another important factor in climate change mitigation and strained by current agriculture (pesticides etc). Healthy soils are also important for sustained food production (especially since population is expected to grow).
* **Peatlands** are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store and ""[although peatlands make up only 3 percent of the Earth's surface, they store one third of the soil carbon trapped in soils globally. Preserving peatlands is therefore of paramount importance for mitigating climate change](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-peatlands-carbon-dioxide-droughts.html)""
* **It needs both reforestation and protection** of forests. [Reforestation is important too](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2017/10/11/1710465114.full.pdf) and is ""[among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76)"" (however [that latter study could have estimated the potential 5 times too large](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay7976)). And theoretically many [young forests can sequester CO2 faster than old forests](https://psmag.com/environment/young-trees-suck-up-more-carbon-than-old-ones). Reforestation projects can also educate and sensitize people to this issue and thereby prevent deforestation.
* I'm **not affiliated** with any of the projects. If this isn't immediately buried I'll keep working on it independently simply because I consider it (effective climate change mitigation within the timeframe of \~10 years) important. The list is incomplete, not only because it puts a focus on technical solutions:
